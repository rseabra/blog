Today I watched an episode of The Cleveland Show (2.17), which seemed inspired on software patents:

<table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Fact obviousness obscuring legalese</strong></td><td><strong>Step</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><em>Here, let me explain. As the truck headed toward the cliff,</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>I deftly maneuvered the door lock mechanism into its "unlock" mode.</em></td><td><strong>I unlocked the dor</strong></td></tr><tr><td><em>Then I wrapped my fingers around the door release lever and applied pressure, causing the door to swing free on its hinges.</em></td><td><strong>opened it</strong></td></tr><tr><td><em>With no time to spare, I sent an electrical impulse from my brain to my leg muscles, instructing them to extend quickly and forcefully, thus propelling my body out of the vehicle.</em></td><td><strong>and jumped out</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>

Of couse, Cleveland's sarcastic comment with relation to Lester's fabulous "invention" was: **So you jumped out of the truck**.
