There are some security tips for your sshd\_config atÂ [http://www.debian-tutorials.com/5-steps-to-secure-your-ssh-server](http://www.debian-tutorials.com/5-steps-to-secure-your-ssh-server "5 Steps to Secure your SSH Server") however the third one, [Change the SSH Port on the server](http://www.debian-tutorials.com/5-steps-to-secure-your-ssh-server#3_Change_the_SSH_Port_on_the_server "Change the SSH Port on the server"), is a lot of hot air.
