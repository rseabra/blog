- @evan you realize your dream of federated social networks depends a lot of people with 1 IP only VPSs, right? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/101102395)
- RT @zack RT @balleyne Very impressed with how patient @evan has been with the anxiety and questions over the [http://ur1.ca/1](http://ur1.ca/1) migration. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/101102405)
- @zack @Evan is an awesome person. I'm extremely happy to have met him IRL, it's truly an honor! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/101102420)
- @evan I agree. There should be a better way. But even though I could setup with ipv6 none of my 3 isps support it. :( [#](http://identi.ca/notice/101102537)
- @evan I also tried via openshift but it was a no go. And they have Apache on port 80 as a front end as well. :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/101102553)
