There are several poisonous sources of information.

Some of them are produced by alleged liberals whom I'd rather classify as **rabid ultra neo** **liberals** **who are void of human rational thought or who are intentionally trying to fool you**, and to all those, I bid you farewell, rot away outside my sources of information.

I've grown tired of reading things that make my blood boil, and you're the first to go, the noise to ratio has been too big, even when there were a few things I might at times agree with you, most of it is just poison on my soul.
