On _black friday_ (we don't really have that tradition in Portugal but stores are copying it from other countries) I saw this very sweet [Samsung NP900X3C](https://www.google.pt/search?q=NP900X3C) (A01PTbut it cost a hairline under 1000€. The ones I was **really** looking after were the 11.5'' ones with Intel Core i7 but they cost around 1600€ over here. Much sweeter, but they'd really set me back a bit too much.

So... I happen to go back to the store a couple of weeks afterwards and it's now at 777€. Woot! (_well, it was the laptop on display, as it was the last one_).

Since I wanted it to have 8 GB of RAM rather than the 4 GB it comes with, I asked whether they'd upgrade the RAM. «_No problem!_» they replied. Oopsie, problem... the RAM is non expandable after all, wielded to the board (the hidden costs of being ultra light and thin) was also a surprise for them, so as I was going to go give up on it they got me a further discount: 699€. Done deal!

So of course I never even booted Windows (the story of the license refund: [part I](https://blog.1407.org/2013/12/15/dont-want-no-microsoft-tax/), [part II](https://blog.1407.org/2013/12/17/samsung-well-refund-your-microsofttax/), [part III](https://blog.1407.org/2013/12/18/mstax-refund-what-were-not-microsoft/), and part IV should start really soon now) and quickly got Fedora 20 in it. **Virtually everything works_,_** with the exception of a couple of minor issues: the keyboard brightness, silent mode and wireless toggle don't work, but the rest... on man...

- Boots to graphical login prompt in **6 seconds**, not counting the UEFI bios, but it's also just a couple of seconds more.
- Intel Core i5 is fast enough, I don't have the slightest feeling of _slowness_, it seems faaaaast! Even with the scaling governor in place
- It's so light it almost doesn't feel it's there
- The full resolution is there, not Full HD like the ones I was really looking after but 1600x900 is very good. Intel HD4000 is also quite fast, but I already knew that since I upgraded my home media center in the summer of 2012, which came with it.
- The keys are evenly spaced, it's quite balanced for my hands and I'm quickly adapting to the layout without any issues other than the arrow keys which are a tad small, but also rarely used.
- The touchpad is wonderful, before configuration I was hating it (_oh... no tap click_) but it was just a config away. Two fingers to scroll, three finger tap for middle button paste, and it turns off while typing. Yes! I wonder if there are more gestures...
- Audio sounds fine, but I use a bluetooth headset anyways (_oh yeah_, bluetooth works fine as well, already bound the mouse too)
- Wifi is working fine, and it's only a bore that ethernet is done via a dongle. It looks like micro-USB, but it's probably not as the interface is already there before anything is plugged
- The SD card reader also works fine

[Jos Poortvliet's blog about this laptop](http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2012/09/linux-and-samsung-series-9-np900x3c.html) is also a good source of what should be happening, and it seems that the buttons that aren't working should work after some help, but samsung-laptop module isn't being loadable, so I expect that's a Fedora beta issue, maybe on the next kernel upgrade it works better :)

The only design issue I found, so far, is that the left USB is too close to the power cord, so when it's plugged it's hard to put anything in without a short extension cable, but hardly a serious issue when it's so cool.

I'm only sorry I was in the eminence of having my WeTab just stop working at a bad timing, because even though I got a very good deal, some other important expenses have had to be delayed to 2014...
