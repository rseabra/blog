_Le sigh..._ it seems that in the discussion between SystemD or Upstart in Debian, a random idiot speculated that SystemD would have been adultered by Red Hat for the NSA.

Bravo, what a way to poison a sane discussion, **troll**.

Since it's Free Software, how about **you** rebuild it from scratch and **you** check it out **yourself** whether it really and **you better post some evidence**, alright?

Speculating such [garbage](http://lwn.net/Articles/578394/) is **not helpful**.
