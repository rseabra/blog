So I went to the Samsung Service Center downstairs... it's such a rare event that of course they were very surprised.

Since their boss wasn't there, they took not of my Samsung contact and case number, photographed the evidences I showed them that the laptop is Windows-free:

- sudo fdisk -l
- mount
- ls each of the filesystems
- and they also filmed the boot process

Now I'm **still** waiting for the next steps... _sigh__..._
