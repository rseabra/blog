Yesterday, a calmer second day of unusually bad weather here in Portugal even for the time of the year, we went to a place just west of Cascais called Hell's Mouth, better yet Boca do Inferno, which is a very _aggressive_ (to put it mildly) part of the coast.

Indeed it was so bad that most of it was locked down so people couldn't go to the more interesting spots, and they did well to do that as some of the waves hitting the coast climbed up a couple of dozens of meters up swallowing huge rocks completely.

Anyone caught by one of those would surely die.

For some reason the camera on my phone thought _sepia like_ would be a good adaptation to the light. I disagree, but still sepia ended up looking nice enough.
