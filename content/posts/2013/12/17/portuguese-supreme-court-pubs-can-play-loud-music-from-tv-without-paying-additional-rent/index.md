Portuguese Supreme Court: pubs can play loud music from TV without paying additional rent to copyright maximalists, confirming lower court sentence.

Copyright maximalists will appeal to EU Court of Justice.

I so wish their racket also gets screwed by EUCJ... :-)

The decision rules that adding loud speakers to a TV does not constitute a new broadcast so there is no applicable tax.
