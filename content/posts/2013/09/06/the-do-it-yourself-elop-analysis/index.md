Ok. If you don't want any of my analysis or commentary or rants. Just the facts. Then Elop can be evaluated as Nokia CEO, for Nokia Corporate total results during his tenure. Or, because Nokia just now sold its total handset unit to Microsoft, it can be useful to see what results did Elop achieve at that handset unit (this includes both smartphones and featurephones). And lastly, since Elop did make a major change to Nokia's largest and most profitable division, the smartphone unit, it is a detail worth considering. No more analysis, just the facts...
