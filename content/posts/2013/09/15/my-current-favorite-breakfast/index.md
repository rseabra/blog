My current favorite breakfast is not for the faint of heart, or those who favor carbon hydrates and demonize fat.

I start the night before, by using a strainer to drain the serum off my sugarless greek yogurt all night in the fridge until it gets the consistency of cream cheese.

Don't worry using a spoon to take it off the strainer, turn it over and give it a dry impact on the cup.

... And it'll just fall off in it.

Then I add half a cup of thick cream (30% fat, more would be better, but I can't find it in Portugal) and mix it even.

One can see how hard it is, the spoon just won't fall off!

Hope you enjoyed it!
