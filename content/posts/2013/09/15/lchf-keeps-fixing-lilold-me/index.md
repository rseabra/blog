So... after about 5 months, a checkpoint.

No weight measures, that fluctuates a lot. More important... belt holes and belt perimeter,Â  that's wearing the same belt, from start up until now.

The relation I had, when I started, was 1st/2nd hole, according to my fullness sensation after meals.

Now... today I noticed I'm just about to start this relation on the 5th and 6th holes, I can already use the 6th hole, but it's not comfortable enough yet for using it the whole day. Maybe a week more, who knows...

That's about 10 cm less in my belt perimeter! :)

I'm now wearing this very cool 501's I bought in early 2010... better than when I tried them on, then.

There's still a lot to go, but I'm almost afraid the people I know won't recognize me by next FOSDEM :)

Upcoming next, [my current favorite breakfast](https://blog.1407.org/2013/09/15/my-current-favorite-breakfast/). WARNING: not for the faint of heart, specially those that still demonize fat and favor carbon hydrates.
