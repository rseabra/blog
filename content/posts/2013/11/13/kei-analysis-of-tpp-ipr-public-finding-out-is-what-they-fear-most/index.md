Urgent: please share this analysis of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement as widely as possible - [http://keionline.org/node/1825](http://keionline.org/node/1825)

And don't forget: US will try to make #TPP the template for #TAFTA/#TTIP; so the bad stuff in leak will be coming to the #EU as well as pacific

What they fear the most is that the public finds out about this.

Most of this text shamelessly copied from Glynn Moody. :-)
