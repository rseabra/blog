My trusty WeTab tablet is starting to give some signs of weariness, so I guess it's time to get a new portable **work** device, maybe one where I can actually do some work.

[System 76's Galago Ultra Pro](https://www.system76.com/laptops/model/galu1) seems interesting, specially with 8 GB RAM and a 120 GB solid state drive, it's under 1000 €, don't know yet how bad it'll be with shipping from US to Portugal, but it's quite tempting, I'll have to check it out after FOSDEM because it'll make quite a dent in my purse and I'd rather not do that with an upcoming journey ahead of me.

The **only** major problem I see with this one is the size, I'd like those specs but with 12'' display size, rather than 14.1, and also below 1000 €.

Any suggestions?
