After finally watching the super famous filmÂ [Supersize me](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/), by Morgan Spurlock, I felt all nice and pandered about all the beliefs I had been brought up in life...

I mean, Surely it stands to reason all they say, and Spurlock is a good movie director so he controls quite well all those pretty little details that keep your suspension of disbelief active while nodding your head because the movie panders to what society has been vastely hammering on us since kids, well, most of my age and close abouts.

But then, I viewed [Fat Head](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1333994/), by Tom Naughton

... and Fat Head Followup...

I can only say... wow.

Tom does an excellent rebuttal of _Supersize Me_, in fact Spurlock lost all credibility to me when I learned that he keeps his data secret no matter how hard you ask for it.

As someone formed in sciences, finding out about that broke the spell completely. Specially when Naughton sprouts out the numbers in a clear fashion you can yourself test, veryfy and counterclaim

Worse, to get to the number of calories intake he claims to be getting at some point, you'd basically have to eat **twice** at McDonalds to get there, unless it's very extreme unrealistic cases where most everyone would have a hard time even finishing their meal.

So, as Naughton says, there's at least some Bologna in there.

In fact, as I'm quite overweight though not morbidally obese, I can attest that most _standard_ diets out there (and I tried quite a few) do seem to be a lot like Microsoft Windows. Everyone thinks they have to have it though they don't, or else they'll have health problems (or be left out of the information society).

There's news for you! As surely you should know, you can use Free Software and not ever be excluded of the Information Society, in fact you get much more involved specially if you become a collaborator rather than a normal user of software (and there's so much you can help with...).

It appears to be just the same with what you eat.

I have started the [LCHF diet](http://www.dietdoctor.com/lchf) since a couple of weeks ago and I feel very fine, so far, though I should really start taking down notes on my weigth, blood analysis and so forth in order to verify that I'm not swapping Bologna type A for Bologna type B.

However, I didn't start this diet entirely from self appointed mastery of internet searching but from a recommendation from Randal Schwartz. Yes, one of Perl's most recognizeable names and main co-host of FLOSS Weekly. A smart person who also believes in hard data and who has been in such a diet for about an year an has improved a lot.

Shamelessly copying from [his reply to me on a Google Plus post](https://plus.google.com/105487854388646525021/posts/9NFQH42HmuB) (before I suspended it due to Larry Page and Google's support of [CISPA](/tags/cispa)) here goes some more good information for you:
