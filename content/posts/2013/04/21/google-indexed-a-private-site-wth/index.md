So there is this site which is still private (has a non divulged URL -- other than two other co-maintainers -- so the old site is simultaneous accessible) and I was very surprised to have received comment moderation notification for some spam comment.

WTH? The domain doesn't even exist **explicitly**, it's under a wildcard subdomain so **how** did this happen?

Well, it turns out that Google has already indexed it... how? A few #disturbing suspicions come to mind:

- Both co-maintainers use GMail (Google scans email contents for better advertisement targeting, **maybe** it also scans for previously unknown websites...)
- They also use Chromium (with likely safe-browsing from Google's service,Â **maybe** it also scans for previously unknown websites...)
- **Maybe** they also do that on Jabber communications
- **Maybe** they also do that on private Plus communications (I'd not wonder if they did it on public ones, it's the "private" ones I wonder...)

So there you go, if you're working on a private website, mind your communication channels, **maybe** they're being scanned and interpreted...

Maybe that's why Larry Page is one of the heads behind tasteless [CISPA](http://cispaisback.com/ "Help stop this disaster even if you're not an American citizen")...
