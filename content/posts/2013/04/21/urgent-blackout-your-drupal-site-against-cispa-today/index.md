Please blackout your Drupal web site against CISPA **TODAY**. This is URGENT!

Please [use this drupal module](http://files.1407.org/drupal/drupal-cispa-blackout.tar.gz) I quickly hacked, derived from this [other one](https://github.com/basekamp/drupal-sopa-blackout) from the protest against SOPA.

I understand it's right on top of the hour, but nobody else did this and I could only hack on it tonight.

[ANSOL](https://ansol.org/ "Associação Nacional para o Software Livre")'s website is **showcasing the blackout during April 22nd**.
