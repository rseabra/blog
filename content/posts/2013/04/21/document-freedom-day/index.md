These pictures have been taken during [Lisbon's Document Freedom Day 2013](https://ansol.org/dfd2013 "Lisbon Document Freedom Day 2013") organized by [ANSOL](https://ansol.org/ "Associação Nacional para o Software Livre"). It had two days, one with a hackfest and talks, and another on the official day, March 27th, at night with celebration concerts.

I was sick as hell, too, with a nasty flu keeping my temperature between 38 C and 39 C for most of the time, and a nasty viral conjunctivitis. That was no fun...
