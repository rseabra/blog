[PR\_ESOP\_2013-04-24\_Processo\_CM\_Almada](http://blog.1407.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/PR_ESOP_2013-04-24_Processo_CM_Almada.pdf)

Straight from the press release, ESOP, a Portuguese association of open source companies, challenged in the Fiscal and Administrative Court of Almada, a public procurement, 31A2012 for licensing and maintenance of Microsoft software, launched in September, last year, costing about 550.000,00 â‚¬.

**The court decided it was indeed illegal and decided in favour of the accusation.**

This is the first judicial decision on this subject matter in Portugal, and it found it was illegal to purchase licensing of software this way, in spite of numerous alerts and complaints by ANSOL and now ESOP as well.

The full press release is attached to this post.

**This is huge!**
