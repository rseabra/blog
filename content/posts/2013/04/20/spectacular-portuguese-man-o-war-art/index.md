There is a couple in Florida, USA, who carefully (for their sake as well as the animals) pick up living Portuguese man-o-wars, take close up pictures over an illuminated table and manipulate the pictures, mostly with mirror effects, resulting in spectacular artwork.

Bravo!

You can [watch a lot more of them at Wired](http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2013/04/aaron-ansarov-man-of-wars/?viewall=true).
