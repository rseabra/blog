[This year's Document Freedom Day](https://ansol.org/dfd2014) happened at ISCTE, organized by the [Dr. Carlos Costa](http://carlosjcosta.blogspot.pt/) (of the Master in OSS) and [Adriano Afonso](http://www.adrianoafonso.net/blog/) (of the Portuguese LibreOffice Community) with support from ANSOL.

The day started with [Arduino Day](http://www.mafralab.org/arduino-day/) in the morning, and after a quick lunch,Â  Dr. Carlos Costa and your's truly quickly opened up the DFD 2014 venue in order to give the most space to our guest stars.

I enjoyed all the talks, first about HTML5, then GIS with Free Software, then Learning with Free Software, and finally Free Documentation in the public administration (_btw__, starting this summer, even internal documents have to use open standards_).

We all ended up on stage in the end for a debate with a very engaging audience on the state of open standards in Portugal.

During all the event, the average number of people was 40, which is an enormous success, but after the event, a troop of remaining few (7) went for a nice social dinner before going home.

It was awesome! A big thank you to all of you!

And now, here are the pictures I too...
