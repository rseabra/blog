So I'm finding out how to get a Windows refund (also known as the [Microsoft Tax](https://blog.1407.org/tag/imposto-ms/)) for an Asus laptop in Portugal, not because it's fun, but because we don't want no Microsoft in our home.

**We're a Free Software home!** We want our hardware Microsoft free, here, see?

I already got my Windows refund for my [Samsung NP900X3C](https://blog.1407.org/tag/samsung-np900x3c/), but a couple of weeks ago my significant other's laptop broke and we've been keeping an eye out for one that would be good enough, cheap enough, and so we found this Asus NoteBook F200. It's not a power horse, but she has significantly lower spec needs, nor demands hardly as much as I do from these wee beasties.

These laptop in particular cost exactly 349 €. I got 46.03 € out of Windows 7 Home Professional on the Samsung so I expect to get quite a bit more than that for Windows 8.1. It's only been about 6 months so it's reasonable to expect a decent refund.

But consider this: if I got exactly the same value back, it would mean the Microsoft Tax costs 11% of the laptop. Yes, you heard me well, it would be almost exactly as expensive as a netbook while being much more powerful. Interesting... felling robbed yet?

Fortunately she's not as geek as I am so although she's anxious to start using it, she's patient enough to get the Windows refund. She **knows** it's possible, she witnessed it first hand in her own household, so **of course** she wants it too :) and that gives me some leeway in the time it could take following all the cautiousness of the first steps:

1. Buy laptop but don't open it
2. Call support, they'll send me their requirements
3. Find out that even though they spelled out my email perfectly, they _misspelled_ it when they pressed send. hmms....
4. Call support again, next morning, complain about 3, got fishy instructions by voice, demanded the email and finally got it.

So the email goes like this:

> Dear customer.
> 
> Case number: #########
> 
> Please, reply to this email attaching a copy of the purchase receipt, copy of the first page of the warranty certificate, where there is the serial number and, as explained on the phone, after activating Windows, a screenshot of the system properties where one can verify its license number.
> 
> As soon as we receive it, we'll begin the refund process for the value of Windows.

> We'll be waiting.
> 
> Attentiously,
> 
> ASUS Iberia.

Erms... activating it??? I did ask for clarification on the phone, because that used to be a **big no-no** previously, but he reassured me it's different with Windows 8.

Well, now I have it in writing... so I'll be letting you know.
