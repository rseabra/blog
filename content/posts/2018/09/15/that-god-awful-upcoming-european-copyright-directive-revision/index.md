So [the European Comission and Parliament wants to give more power to the copyright maximalism extremists,](https://boingboing.net/2018/09/12/vichy-nerds-2.html) sorry... to revise the european copyright directive...

Among other issues they want to:

- tax links to news sources (article 11)
- censor **before pubication** anything citizens want to publish online under the excuse of "protecting" against copyright infringement (article 13)

**Article 11**

The first one is moronic, andI will do all my best to lead to the death of the publishers of news sources who support this.

No more sharing of article, no more links.

I may personally not be liable **BUT** any social network I participate in is, and if they deem my website as commercial in any way or form even I may be liable because of what users publish as comments.

This is absurd, links drive potential customers to you, guys. Wanting to cash-in because a link and a short excerpt points to your page is a very misguided idea driven by avarice.

This is what you deserve: a very slow death by nobody using your services because nobody knows of links to you.

I will do my best with this regard. If you can die slowly and painfully (as a business, not as persons), I will watch with a smile on my face.

Ear to ear grin, guys. Not a slight Amazon-like smirk. Ear to ear...

**Article 13**

Guys... this is censorship at the full extent of the meaning of the word. Government mandated rules that prevent publishing for some specific reason.

> If you believe that software can properly detect copyright infringement, then I have a good piece of land on  the moon to sell you really cheap. I promise to provide a good deed of proof of ownership! Really!

And if you needed any proof, then here it goes... a most recent and obnoxious case where [Sony claims copyright of Bachs works on Facebook](https://boingboing.net/2018/09/05/mozart-bach-sorta-mach.html). Seriously?

Do not even dream for a second that is will get refined and work in the future.

It won't. Artifical Intelligence will sooner take over our society and replace it with repetitive robotic work than do this properly.

And this leeds to a slippery slope of censorship where other rules will be added to the censorship machines...  [and in fact... really... they're already doing it](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/20/17758542/eu-terrorist-content-legislation-facebook-youtube-takedown)... now they're adding the "rules against terrorism", I wonder how many steps until you can't say something against the european authority...
