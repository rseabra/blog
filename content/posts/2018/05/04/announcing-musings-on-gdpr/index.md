I've only very recently really had to face some of the GDPR "niceties" as member of the board of a Portuguese association ([ANSOL](https://ansol.org/)).

From the brief discussion we had, even though I'm a staunch supporter of privacy rights, I had this gut feeling quite reinforced:

> GDPR looks like another stone in the Roman road (of Good Intentions) to Tartarus.

You can quote me on that if you want. I already am quite convinced that other stone (The Right to be Forgotten) was a huge mistake prone to abuse by miscreants unwilling to have egg on their online faces...

Now I have to read it, I bet I will find lots of issues...
