I’ve just release a new version of OMNewRotate ([source](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate-0.5.2.tar.gz), [it’s OpenPGP signature](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate-0.5.2.tar.gz.asc), an [ipkg tested against FSO M4.1](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate_0.5.2-r0_armv4t.ipk) and [it’s OpenPGP signature](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate_0.5.2-r0_armv4t.ipk.asc)).

Solved in this release, with the help of Kumar, is [issue 1](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/issues/detail?id=1&can=1), suspend. It's a solution based on apm suspend/resume scripts, so I expect that to be temporary until a better solution comes along.

[Issue 2](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/issues/detail?id=2&can=1) is also solved, since it resulted from a typo in the previous releases.

Enjoy!
