Hi,

I've just release a new version of OMNewRotate ([source](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate-0.5.1.tar.gz), it's [OpenPGP signature](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate-0.5.0.tar.gz.asc), an [ipkg tested agains FSO M4.1](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate_0.5.1-r0_armv4t.ipk) and [it's OpenPGP signature](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate_0.5.1-r0_armv4t.ipk.asc)), the 'Automagically Lazy Edition' because it's just like the 'Lazy Edition' but with Autotools magic. Yes, I know it doesn't work well with suspend. I've just gotter suspend to work on my OpenMoko, so expect that it is fixed by 0.6.0.

From the [ChangeLog](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/source/browse/tags/release-0.5.1/ChangeLog):

2008-12-09 - 0.5.1 - Automagically lazy
	\* same as 0.5.0 plus auto tools magic
	\* desktop icon
	\* places a starter script
