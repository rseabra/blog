... Marcus Bauer, [who writes TangoGPS](http://www.tangogps.org/gps/authors/1-marcus-bauer) (an app I like but rarely use because GPS eats battery), uses one of my [rotate](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/) versions. Neat!

I really gotta make a new release, but first I must decide wether to move to [FSO](http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/FSO) (of which I'm trying out _fso-image_ since [M4](http://downloads.openmoko.org/framework/milestone4/)) or Debian. I'm kinda of bored of the "hard" way OpenEmbbeded paves for writing applications...
