Woke up 2h earlier because of a problem, solved quickly, took the extra time to greatly improve the heuristics.

If you haven't tried it before, now it's the time to try. If you did, NOW is the time to try again :)

Fetch it now: [rotate-0.2.0.tar.gz](http://files.1407.org/openmoko/rotate/rotate-0.2.0.tar.gz) ([signature](http://files.1407.org/openmoko/rotate/rotate-0.2.0.tar.gz.asc))
