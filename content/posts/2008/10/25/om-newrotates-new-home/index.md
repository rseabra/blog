I was going to place my OpenMoko project on [projects.openmoko.org](http://projects.openmoko.org/) but because the OpenMoko guys couldn't solve [my problem commiting files](https://admin-trac.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1563) (hopefully because they're _finally_ [working on the really important stuff](http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-October/033522.html)) and I wanted to _outsource_ the project's hosting, I moved it into Google Code, so this is it's new home: [http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/)

Currently, the code has integrated some of _Fabian Henze_'s source code changes, but quite sadly he considers our aims as being too different for further collaboration in one project.
