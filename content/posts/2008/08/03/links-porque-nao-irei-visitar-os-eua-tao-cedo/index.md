Como se não bastassem outros motivos estranhos, agora a probabilidade de ficar sem portátil, telemóvel, players multimédia, e outros dispositivos capazes de armazenamento de mensagens terroristas (como por exemplo um folha de papel amarrotada no bolso, que pode ser um conjunto de instruções disfarçadas de futuro lixo), é extremamente elevada.

- [Travelers' Laptops May Be Detained At Border, No Suspicion Required Under DHS Policies](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/content/article/2008/08/01/laptops.html?hpid=topnews) \[[Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/)\]
    
    > "_The policies . . . are truly alarming,_" said Sen. Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), who is probing the government's border search practices.

    > Even more shocking is the fact the contents can be shared "with other agencies and private entities". What are they looking for? Good old DHS says it's to prevent terrorism. Give me a break. Guess what? It's not just laptops, iPods and Cellphones.

It gets better (sarcasm) -- books, papers, and pamphlets and "pocket trash" which could possibly include letters, notes, or anything really.

It's not the policy that's amazing; it's the fact that [the government has actually made it public](http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/travel/admissability/search_authority.ctt/search_authority.pdf). My previous [essay on crossing borders with laptops, and how to protect yourself](http://www.schneier.com/essay-217.html).
