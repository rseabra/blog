- â™º @jwildeboer: We made some progress yesterday on trusted global ID here at ETOY.tanks. Now we need peer review, expect publication soonish. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/43591008)
- @jwildeboer: An identification per person globally... isn't it a bit fascist ? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/43591170)
- Forced to use SUSE Enterprise on a couple of servers, downloading with ten threads from Novell. They didn't like, now I'm barred. #fail [#](http://identi.ca/notice/43664781)
- @jwildeboer that evades my remark a bit :) better include some provisions against fascist usage :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/43665542)
