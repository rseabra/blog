- @glynmoody Also, RMS has plenty times told he has no problem with with many C# and dotNET, you have to look at how Mono and dotGNU differ. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/39988206)
- @lefty dotGNU (at least when I first heard of it) had those issues in concern at it's design. Mono not. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/39988379)

- @glynmoody in particular the paragraph beginning with «Since the DotGNU project is committed to using the GNU GPL(...)» [#](http://identi.ca/notice/39998618)
- @lefty It's hard to miss points which are themselves so lost in webs of misleading (and sometimes contradictory) information. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/39998873)

- @lxoliva Which ones, those that were closed down in Venezuela? And is it a lie he tried to eleminate/raise mandate limit? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/40011370)
- @lxoliva well, I know. But filtering that, you still get those two very damning facts. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/40012367)
- @lxoliva So, yes. Chavez is a dictator wannabe, sadly. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/40012427)
