- Nice pun â™º @gbraad: d\*mn, @reality sucks! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/39453733)
- #oauth adds absolutely no security for an user of a non-web app but adds a lot of useless hassle for programmers. #twitter is run by idiots. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/39502486)
- What U need in order to secure #oauth credentials is what U need to store login+password. Exactly the same. Access that and you're spoofable [#](http://identi.ca/notice/39502646)
- And now that I have finally written an application that can use #oauth, I'm 100% sure of this. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/39502717)
- A SIC foi comprada pela IURD para estar a passar o que parece uma lavagem cerebral? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/39502954)
- Next in line: write #oauth program called bestbrowser which launches firefox and silently deletes all your google data with googlecl creds. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/39503470)
- Feel secure now? #oauth [#](http://identi.ca/notice/39503501)
- Hey, #oauth app writers: you better secure your creds with strong ciphers and ask user for password on startup. If you don't... hmms... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/39505543)
