- RT @arnebab ♻ @agg: Prior art…found in #emacs for the 720 #oracle patents… → [http://ur1.ca/14tt0](http://ur1.ca/14tt0) — how many more patents use Hacker Prio ... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46119154)
- @ricmarques: They used to, I guess I'll have to check what changed and fix reply context in !elmdentica [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46121136)
- !fedora libcurl is borked. With #nss I can't use !elmdentica with https. Recompiled with #openssl twitter works but #identi.ca doesn't. sigh [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46131322)
- And !elmdentica works well with ssl in !shr for !freerunner, so same app, but different libcurls == different bhaviours :( !fedora [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46131846)
- @elmdentica: yup, they \[replies\] sure do \[work\], again! :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46134721)
- @pietercolpaert the computer network diagram part sucks a bit, but it's the best one, I guess. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46135645)
- @hugoaparedes hey guy, you got craX0red, sent me a DM with fucking IPAD SPAM :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46135763)
- @jacerdeira hey guy, you got craX0red, sent me a DM with fucking IPAD SPAM :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46135777)
- @jacerdeira @hugoaparedes And both of you sent the same fucking IPAD SPAM dm, forgot the condom, did you guys? ;) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46136040)
- ♺ @glynmoody: Anonymous Mexican Blog Becomes Go To Source For Drug War Info, Pro Journalists Upset - [http://bit.ly/aQvzXy](http://bit.ly/aQvzXy) blast from future? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46136776)
- @pietercolpaert yeah, simple drawings work, but try to get a 200 equipment network diagram... #iknowsinceiuse [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46137138)
- ♺ @glynmoody: Worlds frst 20 min voicecall from FreeSoftware GSM stack on phone [http://bit.ly/cSUopl](http://bit.ly/cSUopl) could be handy once Android's withdrawn [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46138156)
- Dear lazyweb, is dlink dap 1160 wireless router honestly !freesoftware friendly? They claim so on the box, even 'create your own firmware' [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46151178)
- @reality: I have not heard of an acceptable such policy, which is why I'm not a fan of #fogcomputing in general... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46151887)
- Quem e' o toto q ainda nao percebeu q o q os ISPs querem e' poder vender o acesso \`a net em 'pacotes de canais'? #netneutrality [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46173595)
- @twitterapi thanks to your misguided idiocy, I will be removing direct twitter support from my app starting tomorrow. Bye bye! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46177581)
- TO twitter followers: starting tomorrow I'll be in \*write\* only mode, forwarded from the !FreeSoftware social network. Won't see replies.sry [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46182845)
- TO twitter followers: so if you want to interact with me, you either know other methods, or follow me at [http://identi.ca/ruiseabra](http://identi.ca/ruiseabra) \*bye\* :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46182898)
- @support is there an api call (even if undocumented yet) to get a conversation (a la Pino) in timeline format? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46183993)
- @lamm well, #Twitter is imposing #oauth from Aug16th in client apps. #oauth is bullshit and only adds lots of hassle (both devs and users). [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46184119)
- @lamm since I write a client app (more focused on identi.ca) I don't want to give false sense of security with extra cost: stupid workflow. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46184185)
- @zach: thanks, I won't implement a workaround in !elmdentica as my use case (in !freerunner) is too slow to make multiple requests ok. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46184870)
- @lamm #oauth is an acceptable alternative if you want to give access to your account to \*others\*. But for "my apps" it makes little sense. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46184963)
- !elmdentica trunk can now get direct messages, hopefully sending our own will come tomorrow. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/46186964)
