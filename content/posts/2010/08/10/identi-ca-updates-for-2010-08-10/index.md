- @ddevine: If you used enligtenment you could use !elmdentica in there :) #smartq7 [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45651106)
- @ddevine: I also have a #smartq7 but I let it fall vertically and the touchscreen film got punctured, but without fall signs. :( [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45651279)
- @ddevine: only if usable with !freesoftware like the #smartq7. Even X acceleration had a free driver [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45653258)
- @ddevine: I didn't buy a new #smartq7 because it was already hard to find a new one and it's s3c was already discontinued. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45653762)

- RT @fabsh @rpcutts I don't agree at all. These conversations are very important and the FSF has a very important role. That blog post wa ... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45658436)
- @fabsh: I don't have much time for gaming but one thing I'm sure of is that most 'gamers' don't care at all for their software rights. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45658940)
- @fabsh: They shouldn't. It would be better if they where aware of their rights when they chose, but my point is that they do neither. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45659864)
- @fabsh: A conscient choice is one thing, but no choice done and then pretend they chose is BS. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45660108)
- @fabsh: You said 'all', I never did! I said most... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45660579)
- Well, not today! It turned to the right position so we better wait ! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45663641)
- @phantas: yup ! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45666824)
- Fsck! Thirty five C in the shadow at 11:15... glad to be back into the server room this afternoon... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45666959)
- RT @jwildeboer Rules? What rules? #TheLarry explains that CEOs can ignore rules the rest has to follow. Geez. [http://is.gd/ebfYx](http://is.gd/ebfYx) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45667250)

- @fabsh: Come on, at least agree you're dilluting the meaning of 'important'! It's so for game publisher employees or for professional gaming [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45675662)
- @fabsh: what is important is that one has fun times but gaming is just an instance of that! For @bkuhn that translates into coding :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45676108)
- @joaop: e verdade, congrats and and good luck! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45677984)
- @jwildeboer: joining #smolt would be awesome, but I expect more the NIH syndrome than foul play. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45678289)
- @fabsh: Hey, no need to get angry at me! I understand it well, but you're doing the same you accuse others of, only symmetrically. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/45678702)
