- @zach: gag content is to hide content the user doesn't want to view. I use regex matching on name screen name and status. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/58592495)
- RT @laforge seems like it took until 2010 until I discover the #somafm 'suburbs of goa' webradio feed. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/58593174)
- @ddevine: he's the main source of money for ubuntu/canonical so I guess he kind of has the right to point it at a direction he likes... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/58593322)

- @zach: but surely you know lambda moo, right? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/58595764)

- @trombonechamp: Lack of proper focus is driving ppl into confusion state and mixing issues. Respect is globally Important but not sw ethics [#](http://identi.ca/notice/58604658)
- @trombonechamp: I never read any critic against OpenRespect.org but my analysis jumped immediatly into that vector. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/58604770)
- @mlinksva: or dual licence non code content with gpl and by-sa? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/58613576)
