- @webmink: Would you agree that rand terms leading to rf are so scarce that it's existance, though acknowledgeable, isn't representative? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/58805477)
- @bkuhn: I don't believe you really lost a friend there... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/58806870)
- @webmink: Yes, but so are many strongly patent encumbered formats and protocols implemented as !fs... just look at mono or moonlight [#](http://identi.ca/notice/58809671)
- @webmink: I don't think you defend rand, quite the opposite :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/58809766)
- @webmink: focus on upstream problem, no software patents equals no rand issues ;) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/58810350)
