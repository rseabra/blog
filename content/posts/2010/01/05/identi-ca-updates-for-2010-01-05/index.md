- @carlopiana I know of the SFLC position, but I see other problems which imply that in this case the GPL \*alone\* is not the answer. #swpat [#](http://identi.ca/notice/18217155)
- @webmink I think that the fact that Oracle doesn't seem interested in proposing a solution to the EC raises real questions. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/18217451)
- @webmink If Oracle is not interested in MySQL, they could propose to find another owner. If they are, they should reply with their plans. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/18217490)
- @webmink this duality of choices comes only from the PoV that the deal is at stake on these terms. Silence (to the EU) is \*not\* green light. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/18217558)
- Nikola Tesla was awesome: [http://www.badassoftheweek.com/tesla.html](http://www.badassoftheweek.com/tesla.html) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/18218337)
- @carlopiana I don't see that the GPL is portrayed as the problem, but less copyleft is indeed one solution (not what I desire, for sure!) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/18229657)
- @carlopiana I see that the GPL is portrayed as not being enough in the case of a big competitor buying out it's greatest concern. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/18229709)
- @jargon control-z just after it transformed it into a link. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/18229820)
- @carlopiana My sister in law had #ubuntu NBR on her eepc, but realizing the mistake of going back to #Windows she reinstalled it herself. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/18232569)
- @carlopiana her background is of "international relations", so nothing technical at all :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/18232584)
