- @jwildeboer thought XBMC could display DLNA sources, but I have none to try. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26392029)
- @jwildeboer well, it's an excellent media server (video and audio too), so not just picture viewer. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26393495)
- I erased a lot of users from my blog. They all looked just like spam accounts, but if I've missed you by accident, use a more clear account. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26405984)
- @playya gnome-autogen.sh removed from !elmdentica #thx for insisting! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26407843)
- @jwildeboer The web without flash and it's puny attempt of replacement (silverlie) is SO MUCH BETTER! :D [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26417244)
- @jwildeboer perhaps the gnash team would be the best suited one :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26418001)
- @jwildeboer I'm with you on that :) #tnparty #website [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26419973)
- @jwildeboer So what you want to have is verified accounts, not end of anonymous :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26430361)
- @jwildeboer me too, but that is the price for protecting the honest people that can be punished by the dishonest people. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26430594)
- @jwildeboer at my free software blog I "fix" that by having much more strict spam check rules for non registered users. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26430629)
- @jwildeboer well, yes it really exists unless you control all variables. It's not easy, sometimes, and it can be a real hassle, but possible [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26431339)
- @jwildeboer ok, now you lost me... «Think of the children» is now an approved argument? :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26431421)
- @jwildeboer yes, I know, but it is also a fact that «think of the children» has never been anything but a slippery slope getting worse b/day [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26431786)
- @jwildeboer all have limits, so I say go for it if you mean ending anonymous comments in the places you control because y reached yr limit [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26432201)
- @jwildeboer but you seem to defend end of anonimous information, and that only weakens the good guys who are scared :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26432284)
- @jwildeboer I point out that I never called you anything of the sort :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26432444)
- @jwildeboer you should really read the link @jmcesteves sent: [http://tr.im/TFgl](http://tr.im/TFgl) you're on the side of Craig Mundie (yes, that one) :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26432550)
- @jwildeboer as I view it, if you do it in a broad overachieving way, it is bad. If you do it in your own turf (wiki, blog, etc)... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26433593)
- @jwildeboer ... then it's your prorogative. Demanding the end of anonimity overall has a negative net result, even if it has a few pluses. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26433685)
