- @LuisFCorreia: my point is that if they actually did the upgrades there wouldn't be so many botnets. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/23743456)

- @bkuhn you know that there's people working on getting the freesmartphone.org stack on other phones, right? :) what's needed is drivers :( [#](http://identi.ca/notice/23750948)
- @bkuhn android forks are worthless, just get the drivers and get a real platform on the phone. android sucks as a platform. shiny toy. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/23750994)
- @bkuhn just finished reading your article. my feelings exactly, however you seem to be okay with mere forks of android or meego. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/23751217)
- @bkuhn that doesn't work because of device drivers. our biggest problem on embed devices are drivers. => too much proprietary. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/23751238)
- @bkuhn @gbraad and drivers is what leaves me most hopeful about meego, lest the same brainiacs behing poulsbo are involved... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/23752993)
