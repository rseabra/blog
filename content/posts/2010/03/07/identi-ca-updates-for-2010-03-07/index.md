- Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is another very well spent time even if the 3D didn't add much. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/23951290)
- @chmod755: web can't support OpenPGP safely and securely, never give your keys to a remote server !fsf !fsfe !ubuntu !fedora !gnu [#](http://identi.ca/notice/23976158)
- @sunny256: yeah but that isn't support of #OpenPGP that is sending a normal fil.e [#](http://identi.ca/notice/23976902)
- @openuniverse of course not, don't be ridiculous. I'm talking about webmail. The best you can do is send a file that happens to be encrypted [#](http://identi.ca/notice/23977314)
- @lovenemesis the OpenMoko has about 5 computers inside the device. The GSM one runs a proprietary dedicated OS. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24006201)
- @lovenemesis However, even if we could run Free Software in it (and we're really close to) it needs legalizing or you can go to jail for it. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24006257)
- @rkj I'm kind of hopeful for Moorestown and Meego in the sens of running Free Software in it, but I'll bet it's not open hardware. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24006510)
- @gbraad GSM is quickly growing irrelevant :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24006800)
- @rkj yup, that's Moorestown. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24013274)
- Oh, I think I got it on how to use eet\_data\_descriptors :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24022497)
- @gbraad no problem with my 32'' #Samsung #LCD #TV but it's an older model some 3 years old (or is it 4?). Held in a matte black wall cool+++ [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24024198)
- Descaramento da RIAA atinge novo recorde baixo-n√≠vel (via@mind\_booster):RIAA Claims Music Pirates Hurt Haiti Fund Raising [http://ff.im/h6E0y](http://ff.im/h6E0y) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24025103)
- @gbraad what I love about them is that when ON they don't show lights (at least the ones from same gen as my #Samsung #LCD #TV [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24025135)
- @support @elmdentica marked [http://identi.ca/notice/24027987](http://identi.ca/notice/24027987) as favorite w/twitter api, shows up in favorites, but can't unmark as favorite [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24028207)
- @support "echo | curl --basic --user elmdentica [http://identi.ca/api/favorites/create/17580436.xml](http://identi.ca/api/favorites/create/17580436.xml) -d -" gives error [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24028465)
- @support The database for Identi.ca isn't responding correctly, so the site won't work properly. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24028476)
- @gbraad monitor or tv? :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24028594)
- @support it's an HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24028667)
- @support oh well, looking forward for fix applied date... :) any suggested workaround? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24028790)
- @support is it \*also\* supposed to break when marking from web browser? it's broken through there as well. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24028878)
- @gbraad it seems that if I mark a notice as favorite through twitter api in identi.ca it corrupts something at DB level. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24029096)
