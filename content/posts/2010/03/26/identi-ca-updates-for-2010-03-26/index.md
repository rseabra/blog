- From the I-told-U-so dept. rt @vertexsymphony: nVIDIA Drops their Open-Source Driver, refers users to VESA driver : [http://bit.ly/aKCaju](http://bit.ly/aKCaju) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26220846)
- Not even do they refer to nouvaux, go straight for Vesa [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26221241)
- Nouveau, I mean... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26221452)
- @dandart open it up and clean it. it probably has too much dirt between the fan and the heat-sink. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26223421)
- @dandart that happened to me, I cleaned it and all came back to normal. by then I had a "filter" between fan and heat-sink :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/26223504)
