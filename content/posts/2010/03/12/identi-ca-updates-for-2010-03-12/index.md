- â™º @hook: #Microsoft - #Slovenian government agreement includes an anti-#FOSS clause! !FSFE [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24553900)
- Pergunto-me se o mesmo se passou em Portugal... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24553936)
- @gbraad interesting. But I can't monopolize the TV that way :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24554032)
- @gbraad I disagree, !OLPC grayscale reflexive screen mode absolutely rocks for b&w comics like manga, and even color comics looks good. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24554714)
- ZOMG #followfriday has been imported into #identica and I was mentioned! (thanks, btw) :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24554772)
- @gbraad well, I don't like Manga per se, but I do love the few \*good\* ones I get to read. Oldboy and Lady Snow Blood were my latest. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24555256)
- @jwildeboer 20l? Weakling! I get to have a living dino @ home (a red eared californian turtle bigger than a big human palm). 100l 2/5 full [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24555351)
- @hgfernan thank you for the Free Software port of #followfriday ;) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24555402)
- Entourage is almost certainly not copyleft hardware, but I wonder if Free Software can run in it unhindered... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24555475)
- @gbraad hey, I saved a couple of big turtles from being "abandoned" until they had a fight and required being separated. Male got new owner. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24555827)
- @gbraad the female has been under my care for quite some years now, neat! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24555862)
- @gbraad @jwildeboer hey! All your fish are belong to my dinossaur! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/24556329)
