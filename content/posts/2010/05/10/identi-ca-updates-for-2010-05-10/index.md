- @snarf The \*real\* reason (hidden in that dev's words) is the same more proprietary apps don't get ported to !GNU/!Linux... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31668479)
- @snarf !GNU/!Linux systems are usually too aggressive for the frozen-style of those sterile and clonable apps [http://is.gd/c2ag6](http://is.gd/c2ag6) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31668880)
- ♺ @jwildeboer: OOo should simply state the \*exact\* license and not an umbrella "opensource" without specification or definition. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31700543)
- ♺ @jwildeboer: @charlesschulz @floeff stating "opensource" as a license for OOo extensions is not enough. Please fix this ASAP. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31701423)
- @jwildeboer:if one bothers to read !fsf's public letter, they asked to at least provide a new listing, just of !freesoftware extentions. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31711319)
- @jwildeboer: which is quite different from a so called 'veto'. I'd like to see what is, to me, a miscommunication cleared soon enough. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31711563)
- @jwildeboer:the OOo community council's reply seemed more borderline autistic in an OpenBSD sort of distortion field. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31711770)
- @jwildeboer:as in 'could you do fubar?' vs 'omg you're a tyrant forcing me at gun point' [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31712009)
- @jwildeboer: an #android phone is a good step away from that blackberry you had. Good for you ! :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31712526)
- ♺ @sloshy: The #1 way to make people want to have copyright changed: say that in the USA, it is illegal to sing Happy Birthday publicly. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31715727)
- @charlesschulz: good! Too bad miscommunication led to such escalation, but positive discrimination towards free xtnsns would be better! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31718768)
- @charlesschulz: but your message claims something uncharacteristic which is 'demand of veto power'. seems like overbroad interpretation. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31718981)
- @charlesschulz: don't you remember those words yesterday ? 'effective veto power' was coined in the official reply! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31719788)
- becoming a fan of ventura browser in the !freerunner , if only https wasn't borked (stops loading after ten per cent) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31720516)
- @rahulsundaram: last time I checked nouveau wasn't yet free of blobs, has it improved in that regard ? If so, great news ! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31721654)
- @charlesschulz: that still sounds like overbroad interpretation. I have a hard time believing it at face value... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31721873)
- lol ♺ @TMorais: O começo de uma teoria da conspiração? [http://postal.blogs.sapo.pt/222076.html](http://postal.blogs.sapo.pt/222076.html) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31722539)
- ♺ @zoobab: An explanation of why a computer running new software is not a "new machine": [http://ur1.ca/003as](http://ur1.ca/003as) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31725811)
- @joliveira refere-se 'a mistura vergonhosa dos interesses do football com o poder politico, claro... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31738371)
- ♺ @JoseDePina: Depois de tanto Papa/Fátima e Benfica nas TV's estou admirado de ainda não ter aparecido nada sobre o Salazar. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31741390)
- ♺ @PauloQuerido: RT @31daSarrafada: Ainda não percebi isto: Para quê tanta segurança terrena para Ratzinger? Deus não o protege? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31741730)
- !elmdentica + #ventura + !shrproject == happy !freeruner online experience :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31742497)
- #kvm still gives me an instantaneous reboot in !fedora 12 but I was pleasantly surprised to see plain #qemu survive suspend ! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31743138)
- @gbraad: I wont be holding my breath, I must confess... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31744332)
- @brunomiguel: plain qemu is slow as hell by nature... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31744460)
