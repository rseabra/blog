- Not #identica? â™º@glynmoody Eric Raymond joins #Twitter [http://bit.ly/9qvXzC](http://bit.ly/9qvXzC) "Yes, I \*am\* that ESR." well, of course... #esr [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34014833)
- @bkuhn: unreliable, perhaps. !freerunner has many hardware problems. but 'unusable' isn't fair to all the hard work done so farby many. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34027100)
- @gbraad we're about to have a smaller common awake-margin. Thanks to the Internet 2000km == 10000km, but awake-margin becomes the challenge. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34028144)
- @gbraad have a nice time in Beijing! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34028210)
- @support I flagged @blackotaku by mistake, how can I unflag him? Sorry @blackotaku! :( [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34028429)
- @bkuhn @candrews possible workaround: donate code with a receipt of value (estimate worth per hour and how many hours you spent), feasible? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34040487)
