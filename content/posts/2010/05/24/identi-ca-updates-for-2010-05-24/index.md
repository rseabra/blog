- @carlopiana: are you not mixing the rule with the corolarium ? :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33358070)
- ♺ @glynmoody: Eircom to cut broadband over illegal downloads - [http://bit.ly/cUlQO3](http://bit.ly/cUlQO3) good reason to leave Eircom... #ireland #threestrikes [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33372179)
- ♺ @carlopiana: @jwildeboer yes, we should. This is the best we have for open audio/video, thanks Google. But problems cannot be just ignored [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33372246)
- #Pino is nice, but if it has multiple accounts, it should fetch from all, and not just one at a time... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33372345)
- #Pino looks very much like an early version of !elmdentica when I didn't allow multiple accounts [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33372406)
- Fedora 13 is about to come up! Sadly without OpenOffice.org in it's Live CD, I wonder what's making it so hard to include it... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33372868)
- Evaluating by how much I cut from RHEL/CentOS to get a minimal install with kickstarts, I'm guessing it's a comps or deps issue. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33372958)
- @floschie for developers, I agree, for admins, I don't understand why you need license management. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33377202)
- Streaming em formatos livres! Nada de pagar para só alguns verem! ♺ @gbraad: #Flumotion streaming VP8 in #Ogg and #WebM [http://bit.ly/aXt5Hh](http://bit.ly/aXt5Hh) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33393874)
- @dandart WebM uses Vorbis as audio codec and VP8 as video codec !fs [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33398107)
- @tieguy @fontana I'd rather have a lengthy study because of it being really studied than a rushed one with prejudiced conclusions. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33402160)
- @tieguy @fontana unless, of course, this is just to pretend long and hard study with conclusions already in the drawer. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33402235)
- @pietercolpaert why do you want derivatives of political statements? so you can claim someone said something else? :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33403104)
- @pietercolpaert "BY" means you've got to preserve attribution, nothing about a link back. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33403931)
- @pietercolpaert you can use any 100% proprietary film to explain your opinion. refining other's statements is not a good freedom :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33404015)
- @pietercolpaert and I'm sure that if you ask, they'll let you translate it. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33404042)
- Where have I heard this before? Oh yeah, #swpats ! "all the money has shifted from the lab to the lawyers," [http://bit.ly/bO4wzI](http://bit.ly/bO4wzI) #stemcell [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33420564)
- @smaffulli seems like it's Microsoft #fauxopensource (MS-OSP) but better than redemption.dll (if at all feasible). [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33420830)
- ♺ @glynmoody: Lady Gaga Says No Problem If People Download Her Music; The Money Is In Touring - [http://bit.ly/caoQDa](http://bit.ly/caoQDa) < of course... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33427624)
- The Prisoner (with Ian McKellen and Jim Caviezel) is turning out like a very pleasant surprise! A must watch! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33434949)
- @PiaGuerra: loved Y, never cared for LOST. Thank you for the lovely artwork in it! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33440098)
- @jacerdeira: how about using gitorious instead, which is a freesoftware git hosting service? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33442488)
- @jacerdeira: as to projects, I'd suggest to start by scratching your itches ... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33442607)
