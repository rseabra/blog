- @jwildeboer have you tried disabling modesetting, acpi, etc...? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33299387)
- @gbraad oh ho, please let me know if you get to understand what the issue is (and fixes) :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33299430)
- palhacada! ♺ @mind\_booster: "Papéis dos submarinos desapareceram para omitir alteração de última hora" [http://ff.im/kMzMa](http://ff.im/kMzMa) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33300086)
- @bkuhn will learn about that RSN :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33316493)
- @pietercolpaert @rejon so sad to be unable to go to #statuscheckbru where is teleportation? :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33316862)
- @pietercolpaert I think it's a misbehaved server answer that's not being properly handled. Happens with twitter as well, but only sometimes. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33318575)
- @pietercolpaert only sometimes in identi.ca as well. very hard to find reproductible situation. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33318601)
- @pietercolpaert specially on laptop, where it's much easier to debug [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33318627)
- @pietercolpaert I don't allow curl to freeze, that's pure EFL freezing :) I am in the process of moving to ecore\_con\_url (will solve that). [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33320691)
- @pietercolpaert first, I also had to add http auth support to ecore\_con\_url (done) 1st attempt at converting failed, though, miserably. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/33322090)
