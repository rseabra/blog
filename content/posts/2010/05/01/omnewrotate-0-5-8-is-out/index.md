I've just released [omnewrotate](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/) 0.5.8 which integrates Tim Abell's improvements to rotation sensitivity and I've added some code so it is smarter about detecting the paths for setting the brightness level while rotating which changed in more recent Linuxs (2.6.32 and beyond, I think).

As I'm running SHR-Unstable, your mileage may vary but it's likely it will work :)

As usual, the download links are at the projectâ€™s [Google Code site for omnewrotate](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/) (see the featured downloads section):

- [the ipk of this release](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate_0.5.8-r2.4_armv4t.ipk) ([OpenPGP sig](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate_0.5.8-r2.4_armv4t.ipk.asc)).
- and [its tar ball](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate-0.5.8.tar.gz) ([OpenPGP sig](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate-0.5.8.tar.gz.asc))

SHR-Unstable users should only need to upgrade (later today, or in a day or so).

Enjoy!
