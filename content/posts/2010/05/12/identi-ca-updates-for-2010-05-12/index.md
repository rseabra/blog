- @marcusharrison yes but support for AMD cards lags a bit, so don't expect the fancy new ones to be well supported, but gen-1 usually ok [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31902716)
- @marcusharrison my laptop's been suspending & resuming without any problem, it mostly depends of other factors. Suspend solves a compiz bug. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31904903)
- ♺ @jerezim: 5 jours pour répondre (mm partiellement) à la consultation du Gouv. sur la Neutralité du Net! [http://ur1.ca/z0si](http://ur1.ca/z0si) (pls RT!) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31907275)

- ♺ @glynmoody: #Torture Supporter Peter Ricketts as #UK National Security Adviser - [http://bit.ly/aktP0a](http://bit.ly/aktP0a) not so good (via @PoliceStateUK) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/31934953)
