- @reality: but opkg is maintained :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49796943)
- @sanjayankur: It's impossible to do that securely with #oauth and client applications, and twitter blocks secrets of !fs apps. !fedora [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49798861)
- So it should not be a !fedora blocker [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49799376)
- Last !fedora update of !linux returned working suspend to most radeon laptops. #sadly not mine, even though it worked reliably before. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49800446)
- @giallu: boycott #twitter #oauth! That's what !elmdentica did and we should all do so. !fedora special exceptions are false solution. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49806118)
- I mean special exceptions for 1 app or 2 in any distro is disgusting&exclusive towards other !fs. !fedora and !ubuntu. shouldn't accept [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49806463)
- RT @glynmoody India "will make it mandatory to have open & royalty-free standards" for e-gov - [http://bit.ly/93j9KW](http://bit.ly/93j9KW) big win (via @rcweir ... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49820924)
- @nailuj: You're putting it upside down. I recommend !fs micro blog apps to #boycott #twitter because they impose anti freedom measures. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49822233)
- @nailuj: the clients are functional, it's #twitter who's breaking them with a false security auth mechanism and locking !fs apps out. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49822474)
- @reidrac: What Canonical did with #gwibber and #oauth is not much different than what Novell did with Microsoft. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49822839)
- @reidrac: All I'm saying is that agreements to allow a client on a distribution are despicable. #twitter #oauth is incompatible with !fs [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49823753)
- It's a shame when the shallow goal of popularity makes 'acceptable' to have 'proprietary' software acceptable. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49823947)
- @reidrac: Of course Novell's deal was a whole lot of a more serious level.#sadly both are akin [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49825291)
- @lopo: esta complicado, a minha maior presenca online tem sido o identi.ca via o meu freerunner... sry. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49829845)
