- @nailuj: #Twitter reduced the security and it opposes !fs clients because of its broken #oauth except if one makes #disturbing deals. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49941283)
- @nailuj: who should boycott #twitter in this case are !fs developpers. No clients for you! Same as utilities strikes. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49941548)
- @nailuj: If #gwibber is !fs and exempt of risk due to Canonical deal, just pretend you're gwibber and see how long its secrets last. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49941748)
- @fabsh: Just wait until you try Portuguese public transport network! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49949692)
- @nailuj: That is like saying you should decide on the next strike of your utilities provider workers. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49950029)
- @nailuj: users should demand proper security but !fs programmers should demand respect. No false security and no exclusion. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49950354)

- @pietercolpaert: How about helping to port !shrunstable to n900? :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49979468)

- @bkuhn: That's a sad thing! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/49980822)
