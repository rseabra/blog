I've received an email from eMusic with a change of the payment plans. It contains the following:

> Starting in November **all individual tracks will be priced at €0.49 instead of 1 credit**, and albums will be priced as the sum of the individual tracks. Rest assured, **your monthly payments will not change** and **you will still be able to download the same number of tracks available today, if not more**, depending upon your current plan.

I've just sent the following customer request to eMusic:

> I just received an email claiming «all individual tracks will be priced at €0.49 instead of 1 credit, and albums will be priced as the sum of the individual tracks. Rest assured, your monthly payments will not change and you will still be able to download the same number of tracks available today, if not more, depending upon your current plan.»
> 
> I feel **offended** that you consider me so stupid I can't make a simple division. **My subscription is 16.99€ for 65 download credits making each track cost about 26¢.**
> 
> **What you are doing is almost doubling the cost, reducing my downloads in half.**
> 
> Please **fix this, or I will cancel my subscription**.

Now I wait for their reply.
