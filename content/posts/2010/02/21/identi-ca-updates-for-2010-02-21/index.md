- @tyll that's not what I need: there's a dir with the svn of a project. point and shoot [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22705050)
- ♺ @glynmoody: Criminalise Exotic Pets, not File Sharing - [http://bit.ly/d6E2cj](http://bit.ly/d6E2cj) exposing the Great Lie of governments #filesharing #acta [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22705092)
- @tyll remember me saying I know how to make dist? :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22709348)
- @tyll Guess I'll give it a try. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22710474)
- @tyll no problem :) what I wanted to know was if there was already some script to point at autotools repo's and cut some slack. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22710472)
- Yesterday I saw a N900. It's so impressive it makes me a bit jealous. Too bad it's so proprietary. Good thing is: I don't waste money on it. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22715878)
- @pietercolpaert indeed. I guess the real problem will be when/if my !freerunner stops working for some reason. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22718185)
- @playya #mer (from my tries with a SmartQ7) seemed very un-ready. Probably worse than SHR for the Freerunner. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22718373)
- @gbraad 600€ without any real incentive (too proprietary and no real need for a new phone while my !freerunner works) is too much for me :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22718686)
- @playya Besides, the phone part, battery, graphics, etc... don't look that open to me (quite the opposite). [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22718407)
- @playya sorry, what do you mean by milestone? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22719100)
- @playya get me free drivers! :D [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22719975)
- @playya ah... didn't know... but what I'm a bit jealous of is that the N900 is impressive and looks really nice (UI-wise). [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22719970)
- @jacerdeira: android only looks mature to java pundits. such a limited platform ... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22736597)
- Yay, found the correct set of fixes to ecore.spec.in for getting !enlightenment on !fedora 12 [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22739041)
- make distclean ; ./autogen.sh && make dist-gzip && mv \*.tar.\* /tmp/ && sudo su - makerpm -c -- "rpmbuild -tb /tmp/esmart\*tar.gz" still here. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22742787)
