- Half way through adding members added to our new #civicrm test install. If all goes well, no longer a test. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21892161)
- @jwildeboer #civicrm seems to be very good, I'm still doing my first steps and I know 0 of drupal/joomla either. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21892378)
- â™º @webmink: OpenOffice BACK In Ubuntu Netbook Edition After User Outcry [http://bit.ly/c0xy4i](http://bit.ly/c0xy4i) (Thank goodness, was losing hope in UNR) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21907446)
- One way to optimize manual insert of user data in #civicrm is to create the contact first, then make it a member. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21910205)
- Of course you can only do this if you don't have \*a\*lot\* of members/contacts. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21910222)
- @greve careful, you'll soon need double that! ;) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21916135)
- Dealing with boring administrative work... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21916360)
- @glynmoody "what do you do with FU on BAR" is an irrelevant question. "what CAN you do with FU on BAR" is the relevant one. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21916962)
- @glynmoody answering to questions of "what can you do" limits discussion to the imagination of both speakers. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21917059)
- @glynmoody if storage is not a problem (160G vs 1GB NAND) nor RAM (1GB vs 256MB) nor CPU (varios Ghz vs 800MHz or 450MHz)... why limit users [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21917311)
- @glynmoody answering to questions of "what DO you do" limits discussion to the imagination of both speakers. (s/can/DO/) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21917358)
