- @stephwer everyone is entitled their minuses, mbp is yours, that's excellent! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22169627)
- rt @stephwer: @ruiseabra You're right! Nobody should be perfect... =) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22169855)
- @jwildeboer you could try to dual boot her mbp with fedroa! \*grin\* [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22169952)
- @jwildeboer are you feelingbetter, btw? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22170062)
- #meego discourages L/GPL v3 #fail [http://meego.com/about/licensing-policy](http://meego.com/about/licensing-policy) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22171267)
- amolther #meego #fail besides discouraging gpl3 is aiming to be proprietary-friendly [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22171365)
- I mean another. !olpc keyboard is not so easy to type into. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22171454)
- so the linnux foundation chose #swpat and #drm support. has to be. only real reason to discourage gpl 3 is that. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22171694)
- @pietercolpaert almost same thing but giving them the power to make arbitrary exceptions. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22172533)
- @pietercolpaert read #meego licensing policy and it becomes clear it's oriented toward non-free support. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22172648)
- @pietercolpaert #meego developers will be gratis employees of proprietary platforms. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22172722)
- @pietercolpaert I don't care about what control operators want to have over me. #android and #meego want to help them have it. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22172825)
- @pietercolpaert #meego will never run on the !freerunner. because it's oriented towards non-free graphics cards and formats. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22172899)
- @pietercolpaert yes, but understand what their mission is: less freedom, not more... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22172953)
- @jwildeboer #FSO allows that, too bad one needs good hardware to go with it. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22173020)
- @pietercolpaert will be as free as #android or #n900, aka, non-free in practice for 99.9% of the cases [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22173471)
- @gbraad you're probably in breach of contract with your operator :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22173547)
- @openuniverse #FSO but more developers are needed, as well as a good hardware platform [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22174136)
- @openuniverse visit [http://freesmartphone.org/](http://freesmartphone.org/) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22174833)
- @pietercolpaert have you read their po [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22174866)
- @pietercolpaert have you read #meego 's licnsing policy? because it's quite clear what they want. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22174925)
- @pietercolpaert you understand you're placing your hope in Intel and Nokia, right? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22175392)
- @pietercolpaert while #swpat exist yes, it's very hard for us to gain momentum. they are a barrier to entry. so don't support #swpat friends [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22176104)
- that's what I do [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22176111)
- @pietercolpaert there are no dumb phones anymore, only software makes them dumb or not :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22177546)
- @pietercolpaert even that one :) ok, not so powerfull, but dumbness is sw ! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22177970)
- @kimus hoje e' feriado para os trabalhadores bancarios. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22180109)

- @jwildeboer @evan @zach it would be nice if it could be done without js :) also less js for embbed devices [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22186440)
- â™º @techdirt: Viacom To Record Labels: If You Want More Money For Music In Video Games, We'll Find Other Music [http://dlvr.it/20Jy](http://dlvr.it/20Jy) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22202389)
- @jwildeboer what's the gist of it? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22202851)
- @jwildeboer @rejon if it's at least as open as the OpenMoko phones it's already a big win (want one to use #FSO) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22203053)
- @rejon minimum I desire is what we currently have on normal computers, the ability to run Free Software with the machine whole usefulness. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22203560)
- @rejon but the more free the hardware is, the better. so even if the hardware is semi-hidden, if it can run on Free Software drivers... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22203595)
- @rejon ... then it's way better than 99.9% of the mobile phone devices all around :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22203633)
- Neat, 1st external patch for !elmdentica! :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22203814)

- Next in queue, !elmdentica issues and wiki. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22213609)
- !elmdentica is moving away from #google's geographical restrictions to Free Software developers. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22213583)
- @gbraad that'swhat I'm hoping for :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22221142)
- blod sausage... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22221222)
- At an excellent dinner with bood sausagesand other fumed meat and lots of good cheese and excellent Douro wine! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22221198)
- @jwildeboer envy doesn't suit you well ;) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22221377)
- @jwildeboer it's not exactly blood sausage, it's more like chorizo, but I don;t know the english word [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22221531)
- yum... this sheep cheese from Serra da Estrela really rocks... :D [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22221272)

- About to have cofee and pasteis de nata ("portuguese \*breakfast\*" at some weird place) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22222486)

- @schestowitz @glynmoody I believe cell phones provide a real risk, if you talk inhumanly too much. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/22226095)
