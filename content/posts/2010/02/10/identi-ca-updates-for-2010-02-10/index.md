- ♺ @glynmoody: #ACTA Is Called An 'Executive Agreement' To Change The Law With Less Hassle Than A Treaty - [http://bit.ly/dawqEx](http://bit.ly/dawqEx) quite [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21508397)
- @coolgoose you mean !ubuntu hiding the GIMP and OpenOffice.org and moving to Bing as default search has nothing to do with who they employ? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21508734)
- @coolgoose no, GIMP is not hard to use. That's plain BS. And OO.o removal from NBR is just another way to show ubuntu NBR is less than Win7 [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21520254)
- @coolgoose you totally miss the point. OO.o and GIMP are excellent showcases of the power of Free Software, and are being hidden away. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21522005)
- @coolgoose basic stuff is \*NOT\* hard to do on the GIMP, it's actually quite trivial. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21522044)
- @coolgoose what is hard to do in GIMP is hard because of the nature of what is being done. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21522028)
- @coolgoose I'm not a graphics guru or anything similar, my usage is very basic. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21522070)
- ♺@doctorow: Copyfighters don't want the right to build on earlier works b/c info wants to be free, it's b/c that's how all creativity starts [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21522284)
- @coolgoose those are not basic usages. Sorry. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21524941)
- @coolgoose Besides, you're confusing the scope of GIMP vs the scope of photo viewing with pre-defined (and fixed) set of manipulations. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21525069)
- @coolgoose One is complementary to the other, but one can do all, and the other quite definitely not. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21525121)
- @kimus using Mac? #fail :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21525245)
- @coolgoose select tools, copy & paste [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21525956)
- @coolgoose choosing a paint tool & colour, drawing something. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21525920)
- @coolgoose a 5 y old can do that with gimp. So maybe your users are under 5 years old? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21525982)
- Waiting for a friend, for #sushi while talking about interesting stuff. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21528819)
- Malta, o @czorrinho vai com o nosso PM e o Sec. Est. Econ. e Inovação ao Conselho de Ministros da UE. Sugiro que lhe digam já: não às #swpat [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21557262)
- @czorrinho Não queremos redução de empregos nas TIC, que é uma consequência natural das patentes de software. Por favor defenda isso! :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21557316)
- @czorrinho a verdadeira inovação nas TIC vem das PME, e estas são quem mais tem a perder com as #swpat [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21557359)
- @czorrinho a UPLS/UPLA é fortemente defendida pelo lobby pró-#swpat porque as introduz pela porta do cavalo! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21557472)
- @czorrinho as #swpat são uma interferência governamental na livre concorrência, por favor não defenda monopólios artificiais. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21557393)
- Tomorrow: meeting at the European Council that will have some focus on "competition" and "innovation" from 2010 to 2020. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21557824)
- Ask your government to stop #swpat as it will reduce employment opportunities for innovators. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21557973)
- ♺ @webmink: Dell physically preventing use of hard disks not purchased from them on their servers: [http://bit.ly/bytmUl](http://bit.ly/bytmUl) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21566814)
- Full body scanner. Not an invasion of privacy? Well... [http://www.flickr.com/photos/publius\_ovidius/4346518306/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/publius_ovidius/4346518306/) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/21574446)
