After about 11 months since [the previous release](http://blog.1407.org/2009/05/02/omnewrotate-054-is-out/), I've just released [omnewrotate](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/) 0.5.7 (after short lived 0.5.5 and 0.5.6 as I found out a dangling patch in SHR-Unstable's recipe and did a mistake on the 0.5.6 release) which integrates Tim Abell's init script change and the aforementioned patch.[](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/issues/detail?id=6&can=1)

As I'm running SHR-Unstable, your mileage may vary but it's likely it will work :)

As usual, the download links are at the projectâ€™s [Google Code site for omnewrotate](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/) (see the featured downloads section):

- [the ipk of this release](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate_0.5.7-r1.4_armv4t.ipk) ([OpenPGP sig](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate_0.5.7-r1.4_armv4t.ipk.asc)).
- and [its tar ball](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate-0.5.7.tar.gz) ([OpenPGP sig](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate-0.5.7.tar.gz.asc))

Enjoy!
