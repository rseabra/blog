- @support @heryshoe looks #spammy! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27461486)
- #swpat Is IBM deciding to show how useless are patent promises by suing? [http://tr.im/UFHG](http://tr.im/UFHG) Is this true? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27464599)
- @glynmoody they're proving just how valuable are all those useless patent promises #swpat :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27468672)
- .oO( not at all valuable ) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27468699)
- Eagerly expecting the new OTRS::ITSM (supposed to land by the end of March) with Change Management Process and PINK Verify certification. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27472291)
- @igama estás a estudar ITIL Foundation V3? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27472345)
- @support @willexceltesol is definitely #spammy (and with a quite evident bug in their software). [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27472562)
- Excelente :) ♺ @GabrielfSilva: A couve de Bruxelas: [http://bit.ly/aitzyz](http://bit.ly/aitzyz) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27475088)
- @jwildeboer I half-agree, IBM is merely not attacking free software in general more than they usually do. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27497800)
- @jwildeboer What they do is prove how worthless patent promises are (even without being bought by another company). [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27497892)
- @jwildeboer so if you build a commercial free software you're provoking the established commercial patent promisers? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27502379)
- @jwildeboer hardware is software (except in materials) and, each time more rearely, sometimes unchangeable. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27502677)
- @jwildeboer with the current minefield, what you're saying is that there can't be no commercial free software, and that's just natural. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27502787)
- @jwildeboer oh, I haven't been surprised about this eventuality ever since I read those promises. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27503178)
- @jwildeboer and, BTW, Red Hat's promise is not much better, sadly. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27503392)
- @jwildeboer Red Hat may know that the instant they break it they loose a lot of goodwill and valuable human resources, but it may not matter [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27503473)
- But what if they're bought by someone who doesn't care? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27503838)
- @jwildeboer You're screwed if you have a patent infringement case either willfully or not. This \*must\* be criticised. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27505214)
- @pedromelo confiar nos certificados dos browsers é que é um risco, isto é :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27513835)
- #WTF uma televisão exigir o formato Betacam Digital para enviar um vídeo para produção, e com montes de considerandos arcaicos \*sigh\* [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27514418)
- ♺ @mind\_booster: Liked "Amazon Kindle #DRM Strikes Again: You Don't Really Own Your eBooks | Techdirt" [http://ff.im/iCFnK](http://ff.im/iCFnK) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27539773)
- ♺ @slashdot: Groklaw Will Be Archived At Library of Congress [http://bit.ly/cWHln6](http://bit.ly/cWHln6) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27540478)
- #Supernatural's last season and on the brink of the end. Why do they still waste time with filler episodes? Shitty end coming right for us! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27545452)
