- @jwildeboer I'd bet most fs projects don't want to become monetizable, actually, but wouldn't mind if they did. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27876360)
- Can anyone !fedora confirm that the proper way to use kvm here is qemu-kvm? If so, I get instant reboot after a few seconds on my amd turion [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27902389)
- !fedora Instant \*host\*domain\* reboot.... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27902418)
- @gbraad also when starting with virt-manager, I decided to try out the command precisely because I was trying to find out what happened. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27902755)
- @matthewbooth !libvirt (as presented) is a pile of shit. I identified qemu-kvm as the command used but both produce instant reboot !fedora [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27902860)
- @matthewbooth UI-wise it's a pile of shit, it may be good under the hood, but it exposes very little or is heavily under-documented. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27904116)
- @gbraad I have no solution so far, and I haven't found anyone with a similar issue. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27904162)
- qemu-kvm -m 512MB -hda file.img -cdrom /dev/sr0 -boot d == instant reboot on \*host\*domain\* in this AMD Turion X2 !fedora 12 domain [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27904247)
- @JMF1957: sim, e natural que gostem do modelo de negocio do iPay, encaixa-lhes como uma luva. Mas nao serve para os prosumidores ;) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27919752)
- @floschie: there is no defense but apologism towards #swpat extortionism, which is a great part of #IBM's income. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27920249)
- O discurso da deputada brasileira Cidinha Campos aplica-se, sem qualquer sombra de duvida, ao ressentimento mudo que sente o povo portugues. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27921381)
- Eu ja so lhes chamo pombos ... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27921632)
- @floschie: why are you defending the enforcement of #swpat by known #swpat extortioner called #IBM ? Focus on the REAL issue please :\[ [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27923402)
- Yes, Mueller is crying us a river but defending #IBM on THIS issue is defending #swpat. I don't even care about the other company. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27924032)
- @floschie: you focus on the unimportant. #MSFT is just as bad as #IBM as far as #swpat are involved. read the known Forbes article of 2002. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27924877)
- ♺ @floschie: Good stuff, thx. Agree with you on that "patent madness" ♺ @codepope: You may want to read my take at [http://bit.ly/bQOtuO](http://bit.ly/bQOtuO) #ibm [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27931364)
- Reviewing the 21st week ultrasound taking today, with some 3D segments. Cool \*boy\* comin' right up! :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27931581)
- s/taking/taken/ [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27931603)
- If U believe "in dubio pro reo" then U should be aware that in the case of patents, U go to court to prove your innocence in infringement [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27933031)
- ♺ @jwildeboer: So which rating agency is NOT US based? Anyone else sees a pattern? Dollar is losing, US rating corps shoot on euro? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/27935711)
