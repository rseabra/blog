- @mjnalmeida: eu pus o OpenVPN a autenticar-se com "tu sabes o que" ;) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35730296)
- #xauth solves none of the real problems with #oauth. snce «you still use your \[oauth\] authorised tokens to interact with the API» #bullshit [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35757295)
- #xauth, just as #oauth, is bullshit security for client applications. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35757316)
- ♺ @StopActaNow "The Pirate Bay has stolen about 46 times more $ than actually exist on Earth" - #RIAA [http://is.gd/ckYxH](http://is.gd/ckYxH) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35767950)
- @bkuhn It's good to set goals, I see no problem in #Red\_Hat setting it at $5 billion. What one could see a problem with is how it is reached [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35771337)
- @schestowitz you'll possibly like my comments there... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35772129)
- @support I think I found the behaviour that may be causing unecessary flags. I just accidently flagged @zach. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35774330)
- @zach I accidentally flagged you while I was browsing your previous messages in [http://identi.ca/zach](http://identi.ca/zach) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35774821)
- @zach as I was about to press the "previous messages" button, the page finished loading and javascript focused on the text entry area. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35774918)
- @zach as a consequence of the page jumping up, guess what button is now \*just\*under\* the mouse pointer? Yes.. flag... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35774987)
- ♺ @mjray: @ruiseabra @support that javascript auto-focus SUCKS and had me too! Either focus when the field appears or not at all, please. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35783471)
- If it wasn't unethical, I'd just discretionally block the world cup from the company proxy. Unethical colleagues screaming about it. Grrr [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35792767)
- ♺ @karsten: Proprietary technology is a waste of money, says Kroes [http://ur1.ca/06whd](http://ur1.ca/06whd) My take on Kroes speech at #OFESummit !fsfe [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35802887)
- ♺ @glynmoody: The Rise And Fall Of The RIAA - [http://bit.ly/9fLIDE](http://bit.ly/9fLIDE) just the facts (and graphs) #music [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35811551)
- ♺ @JMF1957: Um despacho que vale a pena ler, o do procurador de Aveiro. [http://is.gd/cLTjG](http://is.gd/cLTjG) Finalmente tornado público. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35818588)
- @jmcesteves: are you Deep Thought 2.0? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35821476)
- @brunomiguel: Obrigado :) podes ir compondo uma lista de blogs a convidar? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35822068)
- @brunomiguel: wiki! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35822751)
- @brunomiguel: mudaste de user? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35824925)
- ♺ @mjvalente: Iceland passes gay marriage law in unanimous vote | Reuters → [http://drp.ly/1aZNc9](http://drp.ly/1aZNc9) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35825050)
- @mairin: to be honest, !fedora already does compromise quite a bit but certainly less so than !ubuntu room for improvement on both of them! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35825240)
- @brunomiguel se puderes tentar agora :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35827364)
- Perto de Alcongosta para a Festa da Cereja... viva as pens 3G [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35827391)
- @gbraad One easy package that comes to mind is Linux (rpm -ql kernel does show some blobs...) but much better than ubuntu in this regard. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35831820)
- @gbraad yes, but it's waste of valuable developer time not having linux-libre as an alternative kernel in !fedora repos. A foreign repo too. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35832683)
- @gbraad bugs should be filed :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35832773)
