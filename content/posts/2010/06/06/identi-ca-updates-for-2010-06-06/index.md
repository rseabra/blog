- #oauth seems like a load of bullshit crap thrown up by a drunken bull on heat. !elmdentica [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35072001)
- Leadership courses given by the military, probably explains why so many portuguese bosses are complete wankers. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35072307)
- They may be nice people, but not leaders. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35072346)
- Hey, #twitter don't drop http auth, just forbid it under http and allow it only under https. Don't be #wankers [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35072844)
- And here's further evidence #oauth is total bullshit: [http://www.jaanuskase.com/en/2010/01/understanding\_the\_guts\_of\_twit.html](http://www.jaanuskase.com/en/2010/01/understanding_the_guts_of_twit.html) #wankers [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35073694)
- @gbraad well, read you from Beijing, then, I guess. Good luck and have a nice journey! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35085047)
- I've got a feeling oauth is incompatible with Free Software if you don't use web apps, otherwise, secrets have to be divulged... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35099794)
- @rejon good journey, be sure to give @gbraad a welcome hug [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35100853)
- #oauth consumer\_secret + consumer\_key == I can pretend to be your app => only web-apps are secure => client apps are not. #twitter #fail [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35121862)
- #oauth is a big pile of crap, security wise. If #twitter abandons https basic auth it's a big #fail [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35122066)
