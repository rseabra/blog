- @brubaker: wtf ? you compare an excellent adaptation with two junk movies ? in the same class? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37019066)
- ♺ @brubaker: History of Violence was a great film. But then, it's Cronenberg, so it has an advantage. Also, a great script. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37032817)
- ♺ @zoobab: Consensus-Oriented Specification System, by Pieter Hintjens, mentions patents and OOXML fraud: [http://ur1.ca/09wtp](http://ur1.ca/09wtp) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37036078)
- As expected ♺ @bigbrovar: powerful comment from a member of the #maemo community. someone who should know [http://is.gd/cVIvB](http://is.gd/cVIvB) Nokia missteps [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37066099)
- @jdub: not really, unless made by truly unbiased people, as recognized by both parties, who understand the issue. Else, it's self serving. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37067996)
- @jdub: a really whiny and truly biased one was made up by @lefty some time ago. Not a good example, and a bridge burner. Mind what you wish. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37068316)
- @schestowitz: meego and freedom? not really... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37068550)
- @schestowitz: I compare android and meego with !openmoko WRT freedom.Both the formers are quite in the 'lacking' category. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37070088)
- @jdub: Perhaps I do. But then... I don't like injustice and react to it. Not enough cold blood in the veins? Maybe. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37070879)
- But then... I try to walk the talk. Been posting from !elmdentica in !openmoko !freerunner running !shrproject with gprs. Main phone, too! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37071229)
- @crispassinato: who are you ? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37071707)
- @lefty: Like talking about yourself in the third person a little bit too much, dude. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37072620)
- @RuiSeabra: any chance you could replace the graphic card? Years ago I destroyed an nvidia graphics card I bought, in protest. Replaced it. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37072964)
- @lefty: Sure, and I'm glad I, at least, make you laugh, dude. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37073511)
- @lefty: That's more of a problem with gtk and current hw, I think. E17 works much better with low resources hw. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/37074360)
