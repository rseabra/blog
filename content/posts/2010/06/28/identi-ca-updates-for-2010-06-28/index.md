- !elmdentica svn trunk supports gag lists with PCRE patterns which are applied to name, screen\_name and message. You'll never read FOO again. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38523204)
- Gag feature in !elmdentica only hides from display. Messages are still fetched and stored in local DB, so just disable and reload to read. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38523303)
- Neither pork nor sausage in #Bilski decision? Is that what should be expected from a 'supreme' court? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38555219)
- I've just committed into !elmdentica 's svn trunk the GUI to edit gag lists. Just add FOO and you'll never read FOO again (case independent) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38602718)
- Seems I beated Pino and Gwibber on implementation of a gag feature... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38603274)
