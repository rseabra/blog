- ♺ @glynmoody: Cyber War: Microsoft a weak link in national security - [http://bit.ly/aoiIsO](http://bit.ly/aoiIsO) stuff at the end of piece is worrying #microsoft [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35621954)
- @support I noticed I wasn't getting any messages from @jwildeboer. Went to his identica page and noticed I have him flagged. Bug? unflag plz [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35629917)
- I would love it if someone could tell @jwildeboer I didn't flag him in Identi.ca. @greve @karsten @zoobab? Please? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35630431)
- @stephwho did he comment on that? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35630877)
- @support feature request: ability to "unflag" so users don't have to bug @support :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35630914)
- @stephwho thank you, I didn't ask you because I had understood you weren't with him today :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35632501)
- @stephwho yeah, they probably are in write-only mode, right now :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35633131)
- @stephwho oh my... not even... oh... OMG! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35634667)
- Increased the messages list area in !elmdentica by moving the timeline description to the title bar and the toolbar at the bottom (+handy) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35644269)
- Type your status here... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35647237)
- @ronnypfannschmidt Good for you! :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35675551)
- Wow! What do you do when str2 = strndup(str1, 8) returns a string with 8 NULLs instead of str1's first 8 characters? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35678999)
- If I printf(str1) I see all I expected. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35679321)
- @tonnerre do what, instead of strndup(str, limit), then? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35680370)
- @support @jwildeboer is not blocked, only flagged. Toggling block and back again doesn't change flag status. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35680778)
- @tonnerre of course not, these printf(str1) is just a contraction, in code is printf("%s", str1) and only exists to debug what's the prob. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35680930)
- @tonnerre my problem is: str1="123456789"; str2=strndup(str1, 8); and now str2=="" [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35681238)
- 20 [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35683813)
- @support yeah, it took some pages of looking backwards in timeline, but yes, I receive. I only noticed because I thought he'd report today. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35683995)
- @stephwho It's an attack on the PIGS, Portuguese and Spanish were robbed yesterday, as well. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35687419)
- But it's South Africa! How could one not expect the tourist attraction of being robbed? Wondering when rape will start showing up... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35695509)
- @smaffulli: gwibber always sucked codewise but has the best UI [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35695980)
- ♺ @glynmoody: Memo From #Dell: #Ubuntu Linux Is Safer Than Windows - [http://bit.ly/ccW8La](http://bit.ly/ccW8La) grab a screenshot before it gets "disappeared" [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35701666)
- ♺ @glynmoody: Lawyers Warn WordPress Over File-Sharing News Blog - [http://bit.ly/c9ll8R](http://bit.ly/c9ll8R) this is an unwinnable war, lawyer people... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/35711892)
