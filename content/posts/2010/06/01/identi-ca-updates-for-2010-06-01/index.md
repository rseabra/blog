- ♺ @gbraad: good interview with @tuxbrain'>@tuxbrain [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34379430)
- @support having problems? @elmdentica can't mark as favorite @gbraad's [http://is.gd/cyyRR](http://is.gd/cyyRR) an error dialog opens up just saying "error". [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34416001)
- @smaffulli don't bother with @lefty as he clearly has some serious emotional issues with #FSF and @rms. You'll just loose your time. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34416141)
- @lefty Interesting (and revealing) that you confuse slander and hate-speech with critique. Notice I never tried to shut you up, so be free. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34416633)
- @lefty It's also interesting (and revealing) that you confuse advice freely given with babysitting. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34416735)
- And now I've just violated my own advice \*sigh\* back to coding... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34416766)
- @support yeah, seems to be gone now. It was via the web browser, but gone now, thanks. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34419293)
- @support and the bug I needed to fix is now fixed. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34419325)
- @gbraad yeah, and what is the most weird is that I thought I had nailed this bug previously... must have accidently reverted the fix :( [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34419395)
- Yay! :) ♺ @puentesarrin: ElmDentica ([http://goo.gl/NVTZ](http://goo.gl/NVTZ)) en Español Perú: [http://goo.gl/a6bb](http://goo.gl/a6bb) !elmdentica [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34421057)
- @smaffulli oh, right, they might just forsake their mission, relicense to whatever just for the popularity of #Apple Store. \*not\*. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34424077)
- @smaffulli they complained and proposed two remedies: either comply with the license, or stop distribution. Bad is on Apple. Their move now. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34424184)
- @smaffulli you have it with openembedded or debian mobile devices. "app stores" just prove repositories are a popular wish. s/repo/appstore/ [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34424321)
- @smaffulli What leverage has FSF over #Apple and their Stores? None AFAICT. Should they care? IMHO they shouldn't. #Apple's a lost cause. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34426431)
- @lefty As usual, 140c is hardly enough for serious talk lest ye be misunderstood. In the axis of user's freedoms, the move is on/from Apple. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34426576)
- AppleStore terms are incompatible with any Free Software license, but more so in the case of GPL which forbids more restrictions. Good IMHO. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34426754)
- @lefty What are the app stores but repo's? I don't understand what you're trying to say. No difference AFAICT. Oh, kill switches! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34426934)
- SO, AppleStores GNU/Linux repos + DRM + single source + no user control + kill switches, what am I missing? #iPay society, not for me. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34427040)
- @smaffulli Removing GNU Go is not stick, stick would be law suite for having done so and demanding retribution. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34427275)
- @smaffulli Removing GNU Go is self imposed from #Apple. Bad is on Apple, not #FSF, for that move. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34427309)
- @smaffulli And besides, there are many millions more dependent on other drug suppliers, like Microsoft. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34427355)
- @smaffulli Removal appears self imposed by #Apple. #FSF has «written to Apple and asked them to come into compliance». [http://is.gd/cyFYl](http://is.gd/cyFYl) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34427934)
- @smaffulli How else are you going to have your rights defended under the current copyright regime? Sad, yes. Alternatives? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34428108)
- @smaffulli It's \*impossible\* for #FSF to make a Free Software mobile "app store" and I hope they don't waste resources on that. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/34428212)
