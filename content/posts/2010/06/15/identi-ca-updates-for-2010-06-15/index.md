- @stephwho: is that per capita ? and still bad ? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36299004)
- @rahulsundaram: but from the end of June onwards Pino will have to implement bullshit security #oauth in order to work with twitter. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36299395)
- @rahulsundaram: well, I plan to drop support for twitter then, in !elmdentica, as they drop support for client applications w'out #oauth. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36299971)
- @rahulsundaram: and I refuse to use any client application that implements #oauth to get to twitter. Bad protocol, deserves no support. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36300129)
- @stephwho: ouch. but still a bit more than the average in Portugal. Perhaps more than fifty per cent higher, not sure of the value. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36300369)
- @glynmoody: techdirt as well. Twitter is going down the drain. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36302821)
- ♺ @jerezim: @FFII backs Parliament Written Declaration 12/2010 on ACTA [http://ur1.ca/07ntb](http://ur1.ca/07ntb) Call n0W! #ACTA #wd12 [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36309099)
- @ whoeveriscallingme: At a boring all-day meeting, will call you back when I can, you can send me email... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36309818)
- There must be... someway out of here... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36311169)
- May $DEITY bless nearby power plugs and 3G data cards... sad I forgot my development disk at home... :( [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36311275)
- @sandersch :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36311852)
- Hasn't it yet? ♺ @glynmoody: Oath Keepers and the Age of Treason - [http://bit.ly/cCHVU5](http://bit.ly/cCHVU5) not new, but shocking: is America going bonkers? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36313189)
- OMG... how I hate being in here... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36326254)
- ♺ @glynmoody: EU Written declaration 2010/29 is "extending Data Retention Directive cover search engines" fight it - [http://bit.ly/c1c68U](http://bit.ly/c1c68U) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36343059)
- @rlafuente depende das datas :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36346878)
- @rlafuente pois, mas "sábado" != disponível para 600km de viagem [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36348856)
- @rlafuente eu sei :| [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36349257)
- In an extremely foul mood, decided to be as rude as possible replying to stupid people who keep confusing someone's gmail with mine. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36357599)
- @rahulsundaram you're not reading @bkuhn's message: «any org that puts acquisition of wealth above all other imperatives» [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36358023)
- @rahulsundaram which is the definition of a commercial org that has shareholders, at least in the USA, for instance. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36358113)
- @rahulsundaram I'm not wearing blinders, I'm pointing out that you're missing a big point and as such unnecessary confusion and argument. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36358860)
- @rahulsundaram but it is indeed safe to assume that for profit companies work and react like lizzards, centered on food (profit) and danger. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36359172)
- @rahulsundaram where danger is "competition" [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36359224)
- @rahulsundaram where danger is anything that reduces food and safety (like competition). Profit quickly escalates to profit at any cost. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36359591)
- @carlg I don't know about Canada, but a company with shareholders has the legal obligation to increase their profit, in the USA. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36359831)
- @rahulsundaram you are right, however the relation is not one of equivalency. NPO doesn't mean more trustworthy, but PO makes it less so. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36360074)
- In Prolog (lest I forgot too much of it) PO(A) :- less\_trustworthy(A). NPO(A) :- !,trustworthy(A). NPO(A) :- less\_trustworthy(A). [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36360355)
- I agree ♺ @rahulsundaram: pointing that Fedora's played that role more effectively than OSI and if list was OSI's primary objective, failed [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36360700)
- Sorry for the contraption of text, @rahulsundaram :( [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36360743)
- @rahulsundaram I think that's on the #tasklist of @webmink, somehow :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36361754)
- @jwildeboer Listening to Janis Joplin? ;) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36363875)
- ♺ @pvilela: Lançada edição 12 Revista BrOffice.org (OpenOffice.org n Brasil) [http://broffice.org/revista](http://broffice.org/revista) entrevista Rui Fernandes do OOoPT [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36374462)
- Any recommendation on a C library for json parsing that's widely available in !GNU !Linux distributions, specially !openembedded ? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36374800)
- @bruce89 thanks, will check json-glib out. why would you doubt GObject could be acceptable? Any particular reason? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36378007)
- @brandonrunyon thanks, will check it out and probably compare with json-glib [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36378054)
- json-c seems more promising for bringing less bagage... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36380001)
- json-c it is, it carries a lot less baggage than glib-json and was quite quick to get the gist of the api. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36391049)
- I like, but it's perhaps too erudite for masses ♺ @smaffulli: Do you like the new sticker from Defective by Design? [http://is.gd/cQEMy](http://is.gd/cQEMy) !dbd [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36398913)
- ♺ @glynmoody: Assassinate a Pop Star By Illegally Downloading #Music - [http://bit.ly/at3O79](http://bit.ly/at3O79) don't they realise this is rather fun? #piracy [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36398974)
- Bye bye #libxml in !elmdentica, welcome json-c (much, much simpler). [#](http://identi.ca/notice/36404808)
