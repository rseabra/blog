- This modsecurity workshop \*was\* being fun until the moment we get to AdminConsole, which is proprietary and not even usable commercially. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38358073)
- I mean, the license even says it \*will\* be possible, which by definition isn't \*right\*now\* . [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38358169)
- @jwallorg why not publish AuditConsole as !freesoftware, hms? I'm having a terrible experience right now... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38358797)
- @reality @gbraad and possibly easier to do, in order to get home quickly and do the really interesting stuff :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38365987)
- @nathaniel73 Who said that just because Google is involved something is good? They can make mistakes, too. googlecl uses #oauth insecurely. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38368122)
- @lefty Puh-lease... you're just grasping at any straws you can get. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38369419)
- @lefty Yeah, just like people copying films in bittorrent nets are terrorists, according to MPAA. You're over-inflating to suit your hatred. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38370147)
- @lefty If you were not lost in hatred, you'd notice I replied to your allegations towards @rms. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38371344)
- @jwallorg Thank you for the excellent hands on workshop on modsecurity! A big plus plus, overall. Funny and instructive! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38374404)
- @bkuhn I think I will be implementing gag lists in !elmdentica, a bit like your feature request but client based ;) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38399325)
- @bkuhn: You're using sarcasm, right? By such reasoning one would better make vows of non expression ;) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38399717)
- @reality: Oh, the hero. That article conveniently doesn't point out a persecution behaviour from the critic, as if it was a single act. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38400431)
- In the light of such critics, all humour should be banned, starting with Monty Python's Life of Brian's stoning sketch. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38402260)
- @reality I find this google search to be more enlightening towards what @rms thinks of Women's rights [http://is.gd/d6DRk](http://is.gd/d6DRk) than any fool rant. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38411268)
- @reality oh, sorry if I let you think I did think so, I didn't mean to imply but rather to give you a good link :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38411688)
- @lefty for philosophers, words \*are\* actions. Also, your critiques are about his words in a joke. Go flog Monty Python instead. More juice. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38412536)
- @lefty yes, any problem with that? I know of several people who were underage with much older partners. Read the full comment he makes. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38412742)
- @lefty I know society hadn't any problem with it for far longer than it has had. But you're just pulling up one fallacy after another. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38414030)
- @lefty That's non-sequitor with the issue at hand, and whether I have or not a problem doesn't validate or invalidate anything, so far. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38414153)
- @lefty Non-sequitor conclusions don't have a point. I'm not really sorry your hate-mongering clouds your reasoning. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38417758)
- @lefty You grasp at straws and inflate them to levels proper of hate mongering. Mere stmt of Fact. Thanks for spelling correcction, though. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38419517)
- @lefty I don't have to support that fact, you do that pretty well yourself, fortunately. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38420663)
- @lefty your alledged "support" for pedophilia from @rms is not substantiated by searching on his published opinions. Not even "that" link. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38420929)
- @lefty oh, those experts.... I know of a couple of cases (both in their late thirties now) of what one would call voluntary pedophilia. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38421986)
- @lefty well, in \*one\* comment he say's he's not \*convinced\*. Stretching it to "support" is hate mongering. No less. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38422101)
- @lefty oh, so in your world one only has the right to discuss his opinion when he has a degree in it? Poor sad thing... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38425487)
- @satipera lol, no need. and if something's stressing me is qemu-native building in openembedded freezing me up... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38425608)
- @lefty how is that related to claiming @rms supports pedophilia? Circular reasoning? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38427246)
- @webmink @bkuhn Come on!... I've seen you guys agree in a lot more stuff :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38428649)
- @satipera I would suspect professional trolling but... maybe he's just a quite disturbed person. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38428766)
- @lefty Well, there's evidence contrary to your "there's no such thing". I personally know two healthy adults who could be poster boys of it. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38428900)
- @lefty I think that's the problem with your opinion, you equate pedophilia with child rape. Not the same thing. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38428942)
- @webmink I feel your pain (but couldn't contain myself this time into participating, sorry). @bkuhn asked for a feature about that! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38429857)
- @webmink I will implement that feature in my client, !elmdentica. I miss the old @gag verb from Moos. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38430310)
- @lefty you're taking an extremist PoV nobody can seriously agree, scientifically. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38431756)
- @tonnerre yes, I agree. But the biological and emotional definition of ready doesn't equate mathmatically with > 18 years old. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38431843)
- @lefty Neither I nor @rms disputed it. I dispute your claim that @rms supports pedophilia. It's not supported by any evidence, just straws. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38431919)
- @tonnerre yes. and not so many years ago, it was circa 12 years old (and those stupid pre-arranged, sometimes incestuous, marriages). [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38432241)
- @lefty you keep grasping at straws, and extending words to mean what you want, not what they mean. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/38436346)
