- @kiakli bah, not in Ogg? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59755584)
- @fabsh Nobody argues against that! but still is a working phone. Anyways, FreeSmartphone.org is more important and grown beyond !freerunner [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59757707)
- @fabsh As you replied without context, I don't know what you're referring to, sorry :| [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59757738)
- @fabsh but even modern smartphones are shit (though some less) if you reduce the proprietary requirements to match !Freerunner's freeness [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59757801)
- @fabsh Well, it's your bashing of a hardware that's clouding the argument. Do view beyond the !freerunner, please. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59757891)
- @fabsh I wonder if I'm talking Klingon, because I'm not arguing that the !freerunner is crap (I agree it is). [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59757932)
- @fabsh I feel a bit offended by your remark, as it seems you're the one who's sounding like a broken record :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59757986)
- @fabsh Well, the !freerunner is a bit more usefule than an Amiga, by comparison. It's more powerfull than my job's phone and that's a Nokia! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59758013)
- @fabsh Enjoy, I know I would! :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59758092)
- @rozzin I'm not tutoring @fabsh on argument, I'm trying to make him see beyond the !freerunner, into !FSO :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59758703)
- @benanov I don't hold high hopes for those projects, hope they succeed, yes, but I'll not wait for them if my aging !freerunner breaks [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59759699)
- @bugabundo Of course not, just DNSs... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59762604)
- @lxoliva there are lots of things that aren't possible or easy, the !freerunner is quite limited, hardware-wise. But it's usable. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59764112)
- @lxoliva eg, I might soon stop being able to use it when GSM dies :| [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59764287)
- @lxoliva both. There will be a great push into 4G networks, acompanied with a GSM phase-out. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59765049)
- @lxoliva yeah, as I said, better than my job's nokia (except that it has more than GSM, 2.5 or 3G, dunno). [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59765094)
- @lxoliva you could have a chip problem, or gsm antennas near you are dying and not being replaced by GSM antennas :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59765432)

- @rozzin: 3g , more memory and cpu and graphical speed come to mind, other than that are nice to haves [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59778664)
- @jwildeboer I have to say that neither #unity nor #gnome-shell had me convinced at any time. Both are quite lacking, IMHO. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/59779954)
