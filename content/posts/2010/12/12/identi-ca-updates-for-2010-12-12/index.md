- ♺ @kevie Donate to #Wikileaks via Xipwire they have agreed to waive the fee and give 100% of the donation to wikileaks [http://ur1.ca/2kgj4](http://ur1.ca/2kgj4) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60259260)
- @bugabundo ui ca bom [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60259778)
- Alt+\` is an moronic US keyboard oriented shortcut #gnome-shell [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60282647)
- @mvalente Vais gostar disto, se não conheceres já, um desktop repleto de JavaScript: [http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60282772)
- ♺ @wikileaks2: Democracy Now - Daniel Ellsberg: Julian Assange is Not a Terrorist | [http://is.gd/iCtgG](http://is.gd/iCtgG) !wl [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60292319)
- @lxoliva: I'd wish Benjamin would not had framed it as an article feeding wood to a fire more understandable with people as ESR as OSI lead. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60301565)
- @webmink: I wouldn't pay much attention to that article as a personal attack. It's mostly of historical reference, seems a bit 'old' in all. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60301874)
- @lxoliva: It definitely wasn't well written. Should've focused a lot more in how to face situations when !fs isn't as good or better,instead [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60302053)
- @lxoliva: possibly but it kind of puts some negative pressure when there has been an obvious effort at reducing the gap from OSI, no? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60302621)
- @lxoliva: Maybe you should pay more attention to what @webmink has been writing. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60304963)
- @lxoliva: One should aim at being more tolerant with what one receives and more rigorous with what one gives. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60305189)
- So, how can a guy go to #fosdem with a six months old baby? So far it seems to me like a #nocando for me... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60305347)
- @lxoliva: He's President of the board, so obviously such a post hits straight for the heart. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60305475)
- RT @jwildeboer @schestowitz same with google mail, livejournal, wordpress.com etc. Running your own server enhances freedom. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60305551)
- IMHO @mako should have focused on the subject because a jab on OSI undermines @webmink's efforts of bridging the gap between communities. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60306681)
- @mako: If I understood the objective of your post correctly, I'd fix it in order to focus more on what it's talking about. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60306756)
- @lxoliva: I don't think he's posing. Perhaps more sensitive today than usual. That poor choice of word attributes malice where none intended [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60306913)
