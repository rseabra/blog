- I think that someone is entitled to be an holocaust denialist, although I think that is a very bad/stupid thing to be. (1/2) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60466462)
- (2/2) The real bad thing is that father & son contributed to spreading fake leaks using !wikileaks name. Not their personal beliefs. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60466523)

- ♺ @telecomix: AT&T Blocks Linux Configuration [http://bit.ly/hDrfny](http://bit.ly/hDrfny) "...only pirates use Linux " [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60476495)
- Mispelling "closed" :) great catch ♺ @webmink: @carlopiana Yeah - they wrote "cloud" instead... (but seriously: no mention of FOSS anywhere) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60488593)
- ♺ @jerezim: @FOSSpatents Individuals should be able to attend such events, don't you think? The EU institutions are sick with lobbying... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60488612)

- @glynmoody my previous statement (in Portuguese) was probably a violation of the law. I don't know. Hard to tell with #censorship [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60495497)
- @glynmoody probably I won't go to jail, they'd have to prove I really intended to incite others to "set 'em up the bomb" :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60495755)

- @glynmoody the change is not so bad per se. The real problem is portuguese law 52/2003 which has dangerously vague items. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60496296)
- @glynmoody this law merely added the incitement (with intent). [#](http://identi.ca/notice/60496323)
