Hey, it's that time of the year when some megafuck dudes drop the strongest advertisement campaigns for selling chocolates, perfumes and flowers to your sweetheart!

But never fear! As usual in the world of Free Software, we like to turn things around 180Âº to turn around the evil powers into good powers and give a much better meaning to things.

As the GNU GPL and the copyleft movement have used copyright's powers to bestow upon us the wonders of software freedom, let's now turn this horrid day into a day of celebration of our love for Free Software.

Thank you all Free Software developers out there! I love your work and hope to be able to stand on your giant shoulders.

Love ya! :)
