Hi,

I've just release [ElmDentica 0.8.0](http://code.google.com/p/elmdentica/downloads/list) with a bit more polished screens and exciting new features:

- you can have more than one account, and if you have many accounts, only a few of them enabled or disabled quickly.
- you have a messages and posts cache (albeit the last one is still incomplete)

So there you go, download if you're too impatient to wait for SHR-unstable to update :)
