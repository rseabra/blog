Today I released [omnewrotate](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/) 0.5.4, which fixes issues [5](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/issues/detail?id=5&can=1) and [6](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/issues/detail?id=6&can=1)

As I am testing the latest 2009 test image, I'm glad to announce that it still works fine with current FSO, but Paroli looks really bad when it goes landscape.

I've also added a “-p” (for powersaving) flag, oriented towards activating, well, more conservative approaches such as reading the accelerometer data not so frequently (which directly implies less responsiveness, but it was asked for).

As usual, the download links are at the project's [Google Code site for omnewrotate](http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/) (see the featured downloads section):

- [the ipk of this release](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate_0.5.4-r0_armv4t.ipk) ([OpenPGP sig](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate_0.5.4-r0_armv4t.ipk.asc)).
- and [its tar ball](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate-0.5.4.tar.gz) ([OpenPGP sig](http://omnewrotate.googlecode.com/files/omnewrotate-0.5.4.tar.gz.asc))

Enjoy!
