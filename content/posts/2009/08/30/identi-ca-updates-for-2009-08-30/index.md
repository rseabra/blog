- @spam: new #spammer on the bock: @Sandoval614 [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9116931)
- Damn, my media center is freezing while playing media :( [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9116954)
- Does anyone have any info on the status of freeness of the drivers for Nokia 900 ? There's a disturbing silence in that regard... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9117813)
- @jwildeboer that's maemo 5, but I can't find anything reassuring. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9118213)
- @jwildeboer quim is very silent on that regard, people complain about it in the comments and nobody addresses it. Not reassuring, as I said. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9118810)
- @jwildeboer less open thank Nokia, perhaps, but I don't really care for Android. !openmoko is flourishing now it's free from the company. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9119091)
- @jwildeboer And I disagree that Nokia isn't hiding the facts, they're playing it as "so open" and yet... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9119110)
- @jwildeboer no, but you can have them on their own chip and talk to them with AT commands (which is how OM does GSM) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9119281)

- Nokia N900 bullshit: Nokia avoids safety risks and liabilities that could be caused by freeing access to certain hardware components. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9119401)
- Nokia N900 bullshit: IPR & licensing issues: Nokia avoids serious risks brought by patents, copyrights or complicated licensing situations. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9119435)
- Nokia N900 bullshit: Legacy: Nokia keeps some components minimally maintained - the work of opening them has an unclear outcome. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9119453)
- Nokia N900 bullshit: Brand: Nokia wants to keep a strong brand and identity avoiding any risks of dilution. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9119468)
- Nokia IPR reasons for keeping some software closed are total bullshit: 1) Nokia promotes software patents, 2) #swpat affects closed as well. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9119850)
