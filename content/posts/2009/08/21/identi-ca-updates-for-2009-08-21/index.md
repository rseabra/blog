- @jwildeboer not convinced current hybrids are much better, what they save in gas they pollute in materials/batteries. Waiting for next gen! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/8534823)
- @jwildeboer compared to an SUV, yes, but compared to an economical diesel car, not so much. If choice is SUV or Prius, Prius, definitely :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/8536031)
- @sandersch in the Netherlands you should use a bike ;) Prius and Civic are way too expensive for the company's leasing plan. Hope for gen+1. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/8536326)
- @sandersch I do so envy you, dutch people :) except for the rain... you have too much of it :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/8536526)
