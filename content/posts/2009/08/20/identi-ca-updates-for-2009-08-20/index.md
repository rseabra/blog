- @candrews not yet, but I'm thinking it's an HTTP issue, maybe something not properly verified in !elmdentica 's curl usage. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/8459980)
- !elmdentica it happens sometimes, but then it just goes away, which leads me to think it's probably some HTTP overloading on the server? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/8460006)
- @candrews TuxBrain is in Spain, so you gotta ask them wether they'll be able to buzzfix your !FreeRunner from overseas, may take some time. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/8460562)
