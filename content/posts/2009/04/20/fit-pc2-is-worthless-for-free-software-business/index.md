FIT-PC2 looks quite interesting for making a Free Software multi-media product which could be sold. It's small. Looks good, has enough interfaces for your needs, and is powerful enough to play FullHD quality movies. nice huh? Except that it will only work on Linux 2.6.24. Except that it will only work on some version of Xorg. Why? Because it uses an [Intel GMA500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_GMA#GMA_500_2) as it's graphics card which is, up to today, only supported through either VESA or a proprietary driver.

Now, since the proprietary driver will hold you back to nearly obsolete software, it's not a possibility. Since VESA is quite the last resort, forget about playing FullHD movies as the hardware decoder will not be available. You'll only be able to count on the CPU, which isn't strong enough.

I wrote them asking whether they'll make a better model in the future, but I can only take their answer as either a sign of sad ignorance or petty insult. Therefore, **I strongly recommend against buying the Fit-PC2, or any other device containing an Intel GMA500**.

So, the least I could expect is a «_No, Sorry._» but hopefully I'd get an «_We're aware of the issue, and we're studying alternatives._», huh? Well, no... this is what they preferred to answer:

I guess the bold parts say it all, don't they? Here's my answer:
