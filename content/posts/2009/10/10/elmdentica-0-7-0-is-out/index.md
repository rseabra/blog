Hi everyone! ElmDentica hasn't had a new release for a while (_\*cough\*cough\* proving it works so well \*cough\*cough\*_), so I though I should share with you the new stuff in the development of this release.

The news are:

- Replacement of the side buttons by hover's fired up **by pressing for about 1s over the bubble**
- Usage of inwins for entering user and domain data in the settings window
- Usage of hoversel to gain a few more space on the toolbar, specially for future features

So that's about it... you can get the package from the usual places, the [project's web-site](http://code.google.com/p/elmdentica/), by upgrading shr-unstable as it upgrades elmdentica on next autobuild, building it yourself, etc...
