- @evan well, regarding my user's IP address today, I mean... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/12341172)
- @evan no problem with #statusnet, it's a local problem. Since I can't Man-In-The-Middle to SSL, I'd like to know what I'm doing. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/12341783)
- @evan where can I give you my IP address (if the huge pain is matching user with IP, I can give you my IP directly)... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/12341824)
