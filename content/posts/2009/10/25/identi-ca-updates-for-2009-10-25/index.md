- @bkuhn I actually still don't understand the statement he sent, though. It's quite confusing, and probably the reason @webmink misrepresents [#](http://identi.ca/notice/12873846)
- @bkhun I didn't know of project Peter... now I do I understand and support @rms and @jamie\_love letter to EC. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/12875526)
- ♻ @greve Harald Welte's advice to #Symbian: It's not (just) the license, stupid! ;) [http://ur1.ca/edx8](http://ur1.ca/edx8) !FSFE !GNU (via @gnufs) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/12877526)
- @webmink I'm really sad Sun couldn't survive, but to be bought by Oracle... sorry, does not forebode well for my interests :| [#](http://identi.ca/notice/12877633)
- @webmink I think it's a loose-loose situation that could only be turned into a win-win or win-neutral by Oracle's destiny for MySQL. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/12878146)
- @webmink if MySQL was relicensed to "GPLv2 or later", (or "GPLv3 or later"), and a good trademark policy similar to Ubuntu would be better. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/12878373)
- Preciso de alguém bem experiente e com mãos de fada para trocar um capacitador do meu telefone, alguém me pode ajudar? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/12881405)
- @tonnerre I'm shocked! You're hard to impress :) that's good news about !fedora 12 :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/12907071)
