- hopefully !fedora snap3's intel drivers work better than Fedora 11's... let's see... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10401374)
- oops... nothing happens, gnome-terminal loads but with no shell failing to create it's child process :( damn !fedora snap3 i686 :( [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10401511)
- Not to bitch, but current state of !fedora 11 with my intel gma 3100 is a sad disgrace, and f12-snap3 doesn't work here :( [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10401616)
- @tonnerre that has to be a hardware problem (maybe drivers, maybe it got rotten)... here it's quite stable except for intel drivers. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10401969)
- And I wish #intel would stop being an idiot WRT gma500. It's not like they don't have the muscle, just lack of will. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10402043)
- @tonnerre 2.6.29.6 here, because 2.6.3x was a problem for me too! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10402066)
- I guess I may try again on a next !fedora snap release, but for the moment I'm going to try !ubuntu's karmic I desperatly want my MM back :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10402106)
- @tonnerre huh? what do you mean, I had cryptoroot with last !ubuntu's release and now I only have the home and swap devices as rest is systm [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10402251)
- @tonnerre did you use the \*alternate\* disc image? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10402411)
- @tonnerre I'm guessing you got the desktop release then :| [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10402626)
- @tonnerre the alternate-\*.iso, I think. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10402813)
- Well, in about 15 min I had !ubuntu #karmic installed, in about 15s later I was logging in, 1min later playing the movie. Let's see longterm [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10403426)
- @uwehermann mostly that's overkill, I don't carry anything much worth outside my ~ [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10403572)
- @jamesthedisciple sorry, doesn't appeal to me :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10406159)
- urk 3D with intel 3100 is even worsely broken in !ubuntu #karmic now 3D is totally useless! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10406655)
- I do not understand how #intel is doing these drivers so badly. they've only gone downhill so either they hire idiots or it's strategy. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10406719)
- Let me state this quite clearly: 3100 with 2.7.0 had working 3D. 2.8.1 \*doesn't\*. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10406765)
- @tonnerre yeah sure, but my rant was from before some updates but, it seems to be faster now! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10406916)
- @jwildeboer do they work on intel graphic cards drivers? I think they do work on other stuff, right? :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10406958)
- seems the updates since the lastest alpha have brought back working 3D, yay. for how long, I wonder... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10407555)
- I take this back (after updates, but for how long?): Let me state this quite clearly: 3100 with 2.7.0 had working 3D. 2.8.1 \*doesn't\*. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10407813)
- @rhk #xubuntu using more ram than Ubuntu is not that much of a surprise [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10412242)
- Ooo... #evolution in !ubuntu #karmic comes with a #couchdb plugin interesting... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10414381)
- Bought a NETGEAR RND2000-100ISS ReadyNAS Duo Storage Server with one 1TB disk. Will add another one. Proper home backup storage. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10414531)
- @brunomiguel it's probably going to fetch data from Âµ-blogs via REST. #couchdb is a RESTful distributed DB :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/10414586)
