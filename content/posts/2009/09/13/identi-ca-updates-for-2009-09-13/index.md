- And so begins the Pre-Crime Division of the Police: ♻@glynmoody Police to monitor people never convicted of a crime - [http://bit.ly/3S3EEc](http://bit.ly/3S3EEc) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9949162)
- select count(\*) from mp\_attendance; == 107396 [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9954035)
- Olha, logo o primeiro deputado de teste faltou mais de 10% das vezes, começa bem... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9954133)
- @tonnerre That should be a bug in grub, but grub is much more friendlier to other OS's than most boot loaders. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9955473)
- @tonnerre I think that's an OS design problem and not even a grub problem. I always tell grub to install itself in the partition, not MBR. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9956104)
- @tonnerre did I mention I only have one OS? :) hehe... well, when I had windows, I only had GNU/Linux as the boot partition. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9956475)
- @tonnerre so I had the GNU/Liunux partition as the bootable partition, and Windows was free to hurt MBR as it wished :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9956506)
- Olha... não houve um único deputado eleito que tenha ido a todas as sessões... [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9957691)
- 5 dos deputados eleitos só lá estiveram 2 vezes! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/9957714)
