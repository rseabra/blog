Some don't like that [FSF is criticizing Amazon for defrauding users of their freedoms with Kindle](http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/kindle-swindle-source-code).

FSF is calling it Swindle, so [some guy say it's whine-like name calling, for instance as in "Andy-Mandy"](http://perlbuzz.com/2009/06/free-software-foundation-helps-no-one-with-name-calling.html).

This reveals that this guy, at best, doesn't know his English. It's a totally appropriate\* accurate wordplay, just check the [definition of Swindle](http://www.google.pt/search?q=define%3Aswindle):

- victimize: deprive of by deceit; "He swindled me out of my inheritance"; "She defrauded the customers who trusted her"; "the cashier gypped me when he gave me too little change"
- the act of swindling by some fraudulent scheme; "that book is a fraud"

See?

Well, at least I hope [Andy Lester's criticism is not because he may have something to gain from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Andy-Lester/e/B002BM2X5U/ref=ep_sprkl_at_B002BM2X5U?pf_rd_p=479564851&pf_rd_s=auto-sparkle&pf_rd_t=301&pf_rd_i=%22Andy%20Lester%22&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1RBQ37WZ416T9NDDKFGG)...

\* so I'm not a native English speaker...
