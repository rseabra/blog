As some of you may know, I'm writing an [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/) client with [Elementary](http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/Elementary) for the [OpenMoko](http://www.openmoko.org/). This, is it's first release. It's almost totally unusable, right now, in great part due to a documentation that could be better (I'm looking at you, Elementary...), but you can already get a gist of what is can do.

Anyway, in the interest of release early, release often, here's a first working release, 0.0.1:

- [elmdentica-0.1.0.tar.gz](http://elmdentica.googlecode.com/files/elmdentica-0.1.0.tar.gz) ([elmdentica-0.1.0.tar.gz.asc](http://elmdentica.googlecode.com/files/elmdentica-0.1.0.tar.gz.asc))
- [elmdentica\_0.0.1-r4\_armv4t.ipk](http://elmdentica.googlecode.com/files/elmdentica_0.0.1-r4_armv4t.ipk) ([elmdentica\_0.0.1-r4\_armv4t.ipk.asc](http://elmdentica.googlecode.com/files/elmdentica_0.0.1-r4_armv4t.ipk.asc))

I won't hope you enjoy because it's really crappy, now, but it loads in a jiffy :)
