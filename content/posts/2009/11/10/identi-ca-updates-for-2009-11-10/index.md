- Have a problem with a Huawei E169, not sure if it's a !ubuntu #karmic or hardware device. No other machine to try, suggestions? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/14286765)
- @jwildeboer no other machine here includes no other iso. found a Linux upstream regression bug about this, maybe F12 also suffers from it! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/14287948)
- It seems there's an alleged fix in a #karmic -proposed repo. Let's try it out. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/14288222)
- Oh.... the slow network :( [#](http://identi.ca/notice/14288228)
- Proposed !ubuntu linux-image update worked for me! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/14289290)
