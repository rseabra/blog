- This weekend I saw a Nokia N900. Too bad it is in practice proprietary software because it's a really interesting device. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/14801233)
- The screen, however, even though it has a large resolution (800x480), is a phone-size small screen. Too small for a good reading. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/14801275)
- But it is a powerfull computer that fits your pocket. Computer => should run Free Software. Which is why I won't be buying a N900. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/14801313)
