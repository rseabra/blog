- @gijs sadly I don't read sweedish, could you give us the gist of it, please? [#](http://identi.ca/notice/14716018)
- @jwildeboer funny how they \*only\* apologise to their customers (what about the authors who where "raped" -- using BSA newspeak? :)) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/14716124)
- @gijs yes, danish, thank you very much :) [#](http://identi.ca/notice/14716556)
- @gijs they could have ISO OOXML because they're changing the standard to be equal to Microsoft Office, by \*discarding\* some changes. [#](http://identi.ca/notice/14716625)
- @gijs changes decided in the BRM! It's like them breaking their expectations in stock, if they decrease them along the year, success! [#](http://identi.ca/notice/14716683)
