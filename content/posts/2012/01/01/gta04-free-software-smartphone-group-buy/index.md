There is a successor for the Free Software phone that OpenMoko Freerunner was. While the Freerunner was officially called GTA02, [this new successor is called GTA04 and there is a group buy effort going on](http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=GTA04%20Group%20Tour).

I know the price isn't very cheap, but we aren't a big company able to order in bulk hundreds of thousands of devices, if not millions, so 449 € + shipping for the first batch if we get 400 buyers will help get this phone into the hands of some Free Software developers.

Some reasons to buy one of these (the tricky part is having a Freerunner case if you want to use it as a phone):

1. you are a programmer, you have some money set aside and you want to help develop a Free Software anti-vendor stack like [http://wiki.freesmartphone.org/index.php/Main\_Page](http://wiki.freesmartphone.org/index.php/Main_Page)
2. you are not a programmer, but you can contribute with other important stuff like testing, designing, and have the money to buy a device into which you'd be able to test your stuff
3. you only want to use a Free Software phone, and as such will have a lot of tolerance towards the inevitable bugs of new emerging platforms that don't have millions of Euros to hire full time programmers, designers, etc.
4. you have some money and would like to give that phone as charity to one of the above
5. you are an angel with a lot of money, and would like to offer the first batch to the amount of registered buyers (under 400)

I would fit somewhere between 1 and 2 except I can't afford 449 € on this, so I'm kind of hoping for someone circa number 5...
