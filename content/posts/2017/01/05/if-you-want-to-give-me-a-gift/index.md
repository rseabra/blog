Get me a wrist watch I can place my own OS in it! :) Give me an [LG Watch Urbane](https://learntemail.sam.today/blog/my-watch-runs-gnu-linux-and-it-is-amazing/) where I can install [AsteroidOS](https://asteroidos.org/), it [looks slick](https://asteroidos.org/screenshots/) and it even uses Wayland.

Amazing!
