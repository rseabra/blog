After having passed yesterday feeling always very worried my pants would fall off, I did a most needed check on pant sizes.

7 were retired for being too big to use, even with a belt 4 I can still use, with a belt 2 perfect fits (and boy did I miss these two 501's) 3 that are still a bit too tight to feel comfortable

This means I should consider buying a few transitional cheap pants in a couple of months,Â  on the sales period.

All this I achieved by keeping myself quite faithful to a ketogenic diet.
