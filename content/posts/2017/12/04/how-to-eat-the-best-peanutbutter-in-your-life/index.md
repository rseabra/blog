After watching [Headbanger's Kitchen's "How to make Keto Peanut Butter"](https://youtu.be/h0-JZ3E0lIA) on YouTube I decided to try it out...

Oh... Ye... Gods... It is amazing! It's, by far, the best peanut butter I've ever eaten.

First try and so good means that those sold in supermarkets are pure crap. Don't buy them, buy peanuts instead and spend 10 minutes.

I loosely followed the above recipe (3 tablespoons of butter, using one of the best Portuguese butters, Milhafre from Azores, and a frying pan of peanuts) and it tasted so good I'm having to contain myself, if I start eating I might but be able to stop before it ends! 🍯
