Hi, I'm Rui, a [portuguese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal) citizen, and this blog is where I express my **personal** thoughts.

See that **bold** on the word personal? Enough warning? Ok, from now on, if you confuse anything written in this website as representing positions of [ANSOL](http://ansol.org/), where I used to work at its Board and now hold a position on its Fiscal Board, or of [SIBS SA](http://www.sibs.pt/) where I work as a Systems and Firewalls Administrator, even if at times they may coincide, **then I'm sorry to say it but you are an absolute idiot, your driver's license should be revoked as you are unfit to drive, as well as your vote** (well, maybe not this last one, but then...).

But if you have understood that, then you're an **awesome person** so hop in.
